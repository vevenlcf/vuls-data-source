  "candidate": "CVE-2021-21419",
  "description": "Eventlet is a concurrent networking library for Python. A websocket peer may exhaust memory on Eventlet side by sending very large websocket frames. Malicious peer may exhaust memory on Eventlet side by sending highly compressed data frame. A patch in version 0.31.0 restricts websocket frame to reasonable limits. As a workaround, restricting memory usage via OS limits would help against overall machine exhaustion, but there is no workaround to protect Eventlet process.",

    "leosilva": "support for permessage-defalte extension or compression extension was added by b7d2a251ad55e1c161aa6c8aa236db456c4c4a21 and it's not present in versions of Bionic and xenial/esm-infra."
