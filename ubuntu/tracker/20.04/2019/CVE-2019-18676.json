  "candidate": "CVE-2019-18676",
  "description": "An issue was discovered in Squid 3.x and 4.x through 4.8. Due to incorrect input validation, there is a heap-based buffer overflow that can result in Denial of Service to all clients using the proxy. Severity is high due to this vulnerability occurring before normal security checks; any remote client that can reach the proxy port can trivially perform the attack via a crafted URI scheme.",
  "notes": {
    "mdeslaur": "same fix as CVE-2019-12523 This was fixed in 4.x by rewriting the URI parser to use SBuf. fixed in Debian's 3.5.23-5+deb9u2"
