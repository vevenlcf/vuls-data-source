  "candidate": "CVE-2020-14310",
  "description": "There is an issue on grub2 before version 2.06 at function read_section_as_string(). It expects a font name to be at max UINT32_MAX - 1 length in bytes but it doesn't verify it before proceed with buffer allocation to read the value from the font value. An attacker may leverage that by crafting a malicious font file which has a name with UINT32_MAX, leading to read_section_as_string() to an arithmetic overflow, zero-sized allocation and further heap-based buffer overflow.",
  "ubuntu_description": "Chris Coulson discovered that multiple integer overflows existed in GRUB2 when handling certain filesystems or font files, leading to heap-based buffer overflows. A local attacker could use these to execute arbitrary code and bypass UEFI Secure Boot restrictions.",
