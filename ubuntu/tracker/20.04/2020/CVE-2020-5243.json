  "description": "uap-core before 0.7.3 is vulnerable to a denial of service attack when processing crafted User-Agent strings. Some regexes are vulnerable to regular expression denial of service (REDoS) due to overlapping capture groups. This allows remote attackers to overload a server by setting the User-Agent header in an HTTP(S) request to maliciously crafted long strings. This has been patched in uap-core 0.7.3.",
