  "candidate": "CVE-2020-15389",
  "description": "jp2/opj_decompress.c in OpenJPEG through 2.3.1 has a use-after-free that can be triggered if there is a mix of valid and invalid files in a directory operated on by the decompressor. Triggering a double-free may also be possible. This is related to calling opj_image_destroy twice.",
  "ubuntu_description": "It was discovered that OpenJPEG did not properly handle certain input. If OpenJPEG were supplied with specially crafted input, it could be made to crash or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
  "notes": {
    "mdeslaur": "per upstream bug, this is a read after free, so likely limited to a denial of service."
