  "description": "An issue was discovered in Django 2.2 before 2.2.16, 3.0 before 3.0.10, and 3.1 before 3.1.1 (when Python 3.7+ is used). The intermediate-level directories of the filesystem cache had the system's standard umask rather than 0o077.",
  "notes": {
    "mdeslaur": "This issue is caused by a behavioural change in Python 3.7. While python3.7 is available for bionic, it doesn't replace python3.6, so bionic is not affected by this issue."
