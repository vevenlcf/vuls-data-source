  "candidate": "CVE-2019-6110",
  "description": "In OpenSSH 7.9, due to accepting and displaying arbitrary stderr output from the server, a malicious server (or Man-in-The-Middle attacker) can manipulate the client output, for example to use ANSI control codes to hide additional files being transferred.",
  "notes": {
    "mdeslaur": " The recommended workaround for this issue is to switch to using sftp instead of scp.  Per https://lists.mindrot.org/pipermail/openssh-unix-dev/2019-January/037475.html upstream doesn't consider this to be a vulnerability, and as of 2020-07-07, there is no upstream fix. We will not be fixing this issue in Ubuntu stable releases.",
