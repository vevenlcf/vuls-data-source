  "candidate": "CVE-2019-13281",
  "description": "In Xpdf 4.01.01, a heap-based buffer overflow could be triggered in DCTStream::decodeImage() in Stream.cc when writing to frameBuf memory. It can, for example, be triggered by sending a crafted PDF document to the pdftotext tool. It allows an attacker to use a crafted pdf file to cause Denial of Service, an information leak, or possibly unspecified other impact.",
