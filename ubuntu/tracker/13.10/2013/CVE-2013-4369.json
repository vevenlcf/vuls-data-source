  "description": "The xlu_vif_parse_rate function in the libxlu library in Xen 4.2.x and 4.3.x allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference) by using the \"@\" character as the VIF rate configuration.",
  "notes": {
    "jdstrand": "per upstream, \"The only known user of this library is the xl toolstack which does not have a central long running daemon and therefore the impact is limited to crashing the process which is creating the domain, which exists only to service a single domain.\"",
