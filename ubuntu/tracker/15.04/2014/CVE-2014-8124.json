  "candidate": "CVE-2014-8124",
  "description": "OpenStack Dashboard (Horizon) before 2014.1.3 and 2014.2.x before 2014.2.1 does not properly handle session records when using a db or memcached session engine, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via a large number of requests to the login page.",
  "notes": {
    "mdeslaur": "the fix for CVE-2014-8124 introduced a regression, which is fixed here: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/142737/",
    "seth-arnold": "The python-django-openstack-auth regression fix is currently only included in the wily package (2015-5-14) -- however, no one has complained and testing hasn't demonstrated any problems. horizon in precise does not appear to take the operations that auto- instantiated django sessions in the newer releases; it looks safe."
