    "mdeslaur": "This CVE was originally assigned to Oracle WebLogic, and then was subsequently used by IBM Websphere. It has been proposed to use it for commons-collections. See: http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2015/11/15/1 Red Hat has assigned CVE-2015-7501 to the issue in JBoss Middleware Suite as of 2018-09-19, no indication that this is being fixed in openjdk, or if it is an issue at all. Marking as ignored.",
    "sbeattie": "according to infoq article and digging through openjdk source, there is at least an embedded copy of xalan xslt in openjdk which is also vulnerable, though it may be just an example of a target class to overwrite via desrialization. same as above for libxalan2-java"
