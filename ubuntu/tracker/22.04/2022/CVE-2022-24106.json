  "candidate": "CVE-2022-24106",
  "description": "In Xpdf prior to 4.04, the DCT (JPEG) decoder was incorrectly allowing the 'interleaved' flag to be changed after the first scan of the image, leading to an unknown integer-related vulnerability in Stream.cc.",
  "notes": {
    "rodrigo-zaiden": "debian xpdf is slightly different from upstream xpdf, and does not include Stream.cc file. poppler, texlive-bin includes xpdf files. emscripten includes xpdf in the tests and could be ignored."
