  "candidate": "CVE-2021-33657",
  "description": "There is a heap overflow problem in video/SDL_pixels.c in SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) 2.x to 2.0.18 versions. By crafting a malicious .BMP file, an attacker can cause the application using this library to crash, denial of service or Code execution.",
  "notes": {
    "rodrigo-zaiden": "The POC from the SDL issue link only reproduces in versions 2.0.16 and 2.0.18 because of the following commit https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/commit/fed84650 In older versions of libsdl2 and also libsdl1.2, even though the commit above is not present, I think that there might be a slight chance to trick the lib with a special crafted input to cause the heap overflow, and patching will not cause any harm."
