  "description": "In PHP versions 7.4.x below 7.4.28, 8.0.x below 8.0.16, and 8.1.x below 8.1.3, when using filter functions with FILTER_VALIDATE_FLOAT filter and min/max limits, if the filter fails, there is a possibility to trigger use of allocated memory after free, which can result it crashes, and potentially in overwrite of other memory chunks and RCE. This issue affects: code that uses FILTER_VALIDATE_FLOAT with min/max limits.",
