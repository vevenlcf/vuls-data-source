  "candidate": "CVE-2021-27921",
  "description": "Pillow before 8.1.1 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) because the reported size of a contained image is not properly checked for a BLP container, and thus an attempted memory allocation can be very large.",
  "notes": {
    "mdeslaur": "while this is mentioned in the 8.1.1 release notes, it doesn't seem to be mentioned in the CHANGES file, and I can't seem to locate the commits that fix this in 8.1.1 vs 8.1.0 This was actually fixed in 8.1.2."
