  "candidate": "CVE-2019-5063",
  "description": "An exploitable heap buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the data structure persistence functionality of OpenCV 4.1.0. A specially crafted XML file can cause a buffer overflow, resulting in multiple heap corruptions and potential code execution. An attacker can provide a specially crafted file to trigger this vulnerability.",
  "notes": {
    "ccdm94": "in bionic and earlier, functions fixed by commit are in file modules/core/src/persistence.cpp instead of the ones presented in the upstream patch. However, upstream reports that versions 3.4.8 and older are not affected, due to code refactoring. See: https://github.com/opencv/ opencv/issues/15857."
