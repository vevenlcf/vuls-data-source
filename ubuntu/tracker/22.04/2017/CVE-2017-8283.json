  "candidate": "CVE-2017-8283",
  "description": "dpkg-source in dpkg 1.3.0 through 1.18.23 is able to use a non-GNU patch program and does not offer a protection mechanism for blank-indented diff hunks, which allows remote attackers to conduct directory traversal attacks via a crafted Debian source package, as demonstrated by use of dpkg-source on NetBSD.",
