  "candidate": "CVE-2021-20315",
  "description": "A locking protection bypass flaw was found in some versions of gnome-shell as shipped within CentOS Stream 8, when the \"Application menu\" or \"Window list\" GNOME extensions are enabled. This flaw allows a physical attacker who has access to a locked system to kill existing applications and start new ones as the locked user, even if the session is still locked.",

    "amurray": "This issue was specific to Centos 8 Stream, in particular as a result of the backport done in https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1651378 so does not affect gnome-shell as packaged in Ubuntu"
