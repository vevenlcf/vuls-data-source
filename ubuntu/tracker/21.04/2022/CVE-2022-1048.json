  "candidate": "CVE-2022-1048",
  "description": "A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernelâ€™s sound subsystem in the way a user triggers concurrent calls of PCM hw_params. The hw_free ioctls or similar race condition happens inside ALSA PCM for other ioctls. This flaw allows a local user to crash or potentially escalate their privileges on the system.",
  "ubuntu_description": "Hu Jiahui discovered that multiple race conditions existed in the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) framework, leading to use-after-free vulnerabilities. A local attacker could use these to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
