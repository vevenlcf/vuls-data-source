  "candidate": "CVE-2022-1015",
  "description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel in linux/net/netfilter/nf_tables_api.c of the netfilter subsystem. This flaw allows a local user to cause an out-of-bounds write issue.",
  "ubuntu_description": "David Bouman discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly validate passed user register indices. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
  "notes": {
    "sbeattie": "requires CAP_NET_ADMIN, however this can be done within a new user namespace and network namespace - so can be mitigated by disabling unprivileged user namespaces."
