  "candidate": "CVE-2022-1247",
  "description": "We have found a race condition bug in rose_connect(). The rose driver uses rose_neigh-\u003euse to represent how many objects are using the rose_neigh.  When a user wants to delete a rose_route via rose_ioctl(), the rose driver calls rose_del_node() and removes neighbours only if their \"count\" and \"use\" are zero",
