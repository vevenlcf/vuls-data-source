  "description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel in net/netfilter/nf_tables_core.c:nft_do_chain, which can cause a use-after-free. This issue needs to handle 'return' with proper preconditions, as it can lead to a kernel information leak problem caused by a local, unprivileged attacker.",
  "ubuntu_description": "David Bouman discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel did not initialize memory in some situations. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).",
