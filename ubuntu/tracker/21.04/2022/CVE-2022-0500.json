  "candidate": "CVE-2022-0500",
  "description": "A flaw was found in unrestricted eBPF usage by the BPF_BTF_LOAD, leading to a possible out-of-bounds memory write in the Linux kernelâ€™s BPF subsystem due to the way a user loads BTF. This flaw allows a local user to crash or escalate their privileges on the system.",
  "ubuntu_description": "It was discovered that the eBPF implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly prevent writes to kernel objects in BPF_BTF_LOAD commands. A privileged local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
  "notes": {
    "sbeattie": "unprivileged eBPF has been disabled by default in Ubuntu kernels as of 2022-03-08, requires CAP_SYS_ADMIN or CAP_BPF privileges."
