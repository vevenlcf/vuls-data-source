  "candidate": "CVE-2022-22942",
  "description": "A vulnerability was found in the vmwgfx driver that allows unprivileged users to gain access to files opened by other processes on the system through a dangling 'file' pointer. Exploiting this vulnerability requires an attacker to have access to either /dev/dri/card0 or /dev/dri/rendererD128 and be able to issue an ioctl() on the resulting file descriptor. Systems without the vmwgfx driver loaded are not affected.",
  "ubuntu_description": "It was discovered that the VMware Virtual GPU driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain failure conditions, leading to a stale entry in the file descriptor table. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information or possibly gain administrative privileges.",
