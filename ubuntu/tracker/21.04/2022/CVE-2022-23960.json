  "candidate": "CVE-2022-23960",
  "description": "Certain Arm Cortex and Neoverse processors through 2022-03-08 do not properly restrict cache speculation, aka Spectre-BHB. An attacker can leverage the shared branch history in the Branch History Buffer (BHB) to influence mispredicted branches. Then, cache allocation can allow the attacker to obtain sensitive information.",
  "ubuntu_description": "Enrico Barberis, Pietro Frigo, Marius Muench, Herbert Bos, and Cristiano Giuffrida discovered that hardware mitigations added by ARM to their processors to address Spectre-BTI were insufficient. A local attacker could potentially use this to expose sensitive information.",
  "notes": {
    "sbeattie": "unprivileged eBPF was already disabled by default for 5.13 and newer kernels"
