  "description": "kernel/bpf/verifier.c in the Linux kernel through 5.15.14 allows local users to gain privileges because of the availability of pointer arithmetic via certain *_OR_NULL pointer types.",
  "ubuntu_description": "It was discovered that the BPF verifier in the Linux kernel did not properly restrict pointer types in certain situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
