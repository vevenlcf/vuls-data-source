  "candidate": "CVE-2022-24448",
  "description": "An issue was discovered in fs/nfs/dir.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.5. If an application sets the O_DIRECTORY flag, and tries to open a regular file, nfs_atomic_open() performs a regular lookup. If a regular file is found, ENOTDIR should occur, but the server instead returns uninitialized data in the file descriptor.",
  "ubuntu_description": "Lyu Tao discovered that the NFS implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle requests to open a directory on a regular file. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).",
