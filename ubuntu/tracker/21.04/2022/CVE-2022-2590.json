  "description": "An unprivileged user can modify file content of a shmem (tmpfs) file, even if that user does not have write permissions to the underlying file. The file could be an executable and similar considerations as for Dirty COW (CVE-2016-5195) should apply.",
  "ubuntu_description": "David Hildenbrand discovered that a race condition existed in the memory manager of the Linux kernel when handling copy-on-write with shared memory pages. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code.",
