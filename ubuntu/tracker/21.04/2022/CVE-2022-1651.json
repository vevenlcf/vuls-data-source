  "description": "A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel in acrn_dev_ioctl in the drivers/virt/acrn/hsm.c function in how the ACRN Device Model emulates virtual NICs in VM. This flaw allows a local privileged attacker to leak unauthorized kernel information, causing a denial of service.",
  "ubuntu_description": "It was discovered that the ACRN Hypervisor Service Module implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in some situations. A local privileged attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).",
