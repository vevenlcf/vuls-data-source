  "candidate": "CVE-2019-16254",
  "description": "Ruby through 2.4.7, 2.5.x through 2.5.6, and 2.6.x through 2.6.4 allows HTTP Response Splitting. If a program using WEBrick inserts untrusted input into the response header, an attacker can exploit it to insert a newline character to split a header, and inject malicious content to deceive clients. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2017-17742, which addressed the CRLF vector, but did not address an isolated CR or an isolated LF.",
  "ubuntu_description": "It was discovered that JRuby mishandled newline characters in HTTP response headers. A remote attacker could use this vulnerability to display malicious content to HTTP clients.",
