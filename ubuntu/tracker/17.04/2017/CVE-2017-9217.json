  "description": "systemd-resolved through 233 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) via a crafted DNS response with an empty question section.",
  "notes": {
    "tyhicks": "I believe that this was introduced in v223 by https://github.com/systemd/systemd/commit/29815b6c608b836cada5e349d06a96b63eaa65f3 Lennart pointed out in the pull request that systemd-resolved is respawned after crashing. Therefore, I've rated this as a low priority. systemd-resolved became the default DNS resolver in Zesty and it is enabled in Yakkety systemd-resolved is not used by default in Xenial. It is spawned if a user execs the systemd-resolve utility but that shouldn't impact the system."
