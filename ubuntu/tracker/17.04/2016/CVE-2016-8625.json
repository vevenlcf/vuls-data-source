  "candidate": "CVE-2016-8625",
  "description": "curl before version 7.51.0 uses outdated IDNA 2003 standard to handle International Domain Names and this may lead users to potentially and unknowingly issue network transfer requests to the wrong host.",
  "notes": {
    "mdeslaur": "upstream patch switched from libidn to libidn2 and may be causing issues, see: https://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2016-11/0033.html http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2016/q4/333  Fixing this is intrusive and is likely to cause regressions in stable releases. As such, we will not be fixing this issue in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and earlier."
