  "candidate": "CVE-2015-1781",
  "description": "Buffer overflow in the gethostbyname_r and other unspecified NSS functions in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) before 2.22 allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or execute arbitrary code via a crafted DNS response, which triggers a call with a misaligned buffer.",
  "ubuntu_description": "Arjun Shankar discovered that in certain situations the nss_dns code in the GNU C Library did not properly account buffer sizes when passed an unaligned buffer. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
  "notes": {
    "sbeattie": "only happens if gethostbyname_r etc functions are called with a misaligned buffer, which according to upstream in practice does not happen often"
