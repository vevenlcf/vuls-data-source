  "notes": {
    "mdeslaur": "upsteam bug says this is an issue with php, and are not going to fix, so marking this as not-affected",
    "seth-arnold": "This might be disputed, Tavis says it is likely php misusing the pcre3 API. I suspect allowing attackers to supply regular expressions is always going to be a bad idea."
