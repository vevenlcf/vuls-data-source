  "candidate": "CVE-2021-22923",
  "description": "When curl is instructed to get content using the metalink feature, and a user name and password are used to download the metalink XML file, those same credentials are then subsequently passed on to each of the servers from which curl will download or try to download the contents from. Often contrary to the user's expectations and intentions and without telling the user it happened.",
  "notes": {
    "mdeslaur": "introduced in 7.27.0 per upstream \"curl has completely removed the metalink feature as of 7.78.0. No fix for this flaw will be produced by the curl project. The fix for earlier versions is to rebuild curl with the metalink support switched off!\" Ubuntu builds curl with metalink support switched off already."
