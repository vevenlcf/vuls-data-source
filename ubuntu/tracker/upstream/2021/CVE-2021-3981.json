  "candidate": "CVE-2021-3981",
  "description": "A flaw in grub2 was found where its configuration file, known as grub.cfg, is being created with the wrong permission set allowing non privileged users to read its content. This represents a low severity confidentiality issue, as those users can eventually read any encrypted passwords present in grub.cfg. This flaw affects grub2 2.06 and previous versions. This issue has been fixed in grub upstream but no version with the fix is currently released.",
  "notes": {
    "mdeslaur": "I'm not sure what this CVE is about. Our grub-mkconfig script only makes grub.cfg world-readable if there is no password in it. See also: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/grub2/+bug/248843"
