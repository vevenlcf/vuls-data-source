  "candidate": "CVE-2021-36690",
  "description": "** DISPUTED ** A segmentation fault can occur in the sqlite3.exe command-line component of SQLite 3.36.0 via the idxGetTableInfo function when there is a crafted SQL query. NOTE: the vendor disputes the relevance of this report because a sqlite3.exe user already has full privileges (e.g., is intentionally allowed to execute commands). This report does NOT imply any problem in the SQLite library.",
