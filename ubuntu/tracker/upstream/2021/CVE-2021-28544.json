  "candidate": "CVE-2021-28544",
  "description": "Apache Subversion SVN authz protected copyfrom paths regression Subversion servers reveal 'copyfrom' paths that should be hidden according to configured path-based authorization (authz) rules. When a node has been copied from a protected location, users with access to the copy can see the 'copyfrom' path of the original. This also reveals the fact that the node was copied. Only the 'copyfrom' path is revealed; not its contents. Both httpd and svnserve servers are vulnerable.",
  "ubuntu_description": "Evgeny Kotkov discovered that subversion servers did not properly follow path-based authorization rules in certain cases. An attacker could potentially use this issue to retrieve information about private paths.",
