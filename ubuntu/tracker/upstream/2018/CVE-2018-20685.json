  "candidate": "CVE-2018-20685",
  "description": "In OpenSSH 7.9, scp.c in the scp client allows remote SSH servers to bypass intended access restrictions via the filename of . or an empty filename. The impact is modifying the permissions of the target directory on the client side.",
  "notes": {
    "mdeslaur": " The recommended workaround for this issue is to switch to using sftp instead of scp.",
    "seth-arnold": "openssh-ssh1 is provided for compatibility with old devices that cannot be upgraded to modern protocols. Thus we may not provide security support for this package if doing so would prevent access to equipment."
