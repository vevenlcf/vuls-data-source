  "candidate": "CVE-2018-13405",
  "description": "The inode_init_owner function in fs/inode.c in the Linux kernel through 3.16 allows local users to create files with an unintended group ownership, in a scenario where a directory is SGID to a certain group and is writable by a user who is not a member of that group. Here, the non-member can trigger creation of a plain file whose group ownership is that group. The intended behavior was that the non-member can trigger creation of a directory (but not a plain file) whose group ownership is that group. The non-member can escalate privileges by making the plain file executable and SGID.",
  "ubuntu_description": "It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly handle setgid file creation when performed by a non-member of the group. A local attacker could use this to gain elevated privileges.",
  "notes": {
    "tyhicks": "While inode_init_owner() has only been vulnerable since its introduction in a1bd120d13e586ea1c424048fd2c8420a442852a, this flaw has been present in individual filesystems since the beginning of the kernel git history."
