  "candidate": "CVE-2019-8341",
  "description": "** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in Jinja2 2.10. The from_string function is prone to Server Side Template Injection (SSTI) where it takes the \"source\" parameter as a template object, renders it, and then returns it. The attacker can exploit it with {{INJECTION COMMANDS}} in a URI. NOTE: The maintainer and multiple third parties believe that this vulnerability isn't valid because users shouldn't use untrusted templates without sandboxing.",
