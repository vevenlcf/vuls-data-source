  "candidate": "CVE-2007-6200",
  "description": "Unspecified vulnerability in rsync before 3.0.0pre6, when running a writable rsync daemon, allows remote attackers to bypass exclude, exclude_from, and filter and read or write hidden files via (1) symlink, (2) partial-dir, (3) backup-dir, and unspecified (4) dest options.",
  "notes": {
    "jdstrand": "lowering priority as it is only for rsyncd.  This is a non-standard configuration. There is currently no patch (though it seems one is being worked on), but there is a workaround: use this in rsyncd.conf: refuse options = --*-dest --partial-dir --backup-dir Should have a man page update if pushing this out without a patch"
