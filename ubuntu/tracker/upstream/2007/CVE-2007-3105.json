{
  "candidate": "CVE-2007-3105",
  "description": "Stack-based buffer overflow in the random number generator (RNG) implementation in the Linux kernel before 2.6.22 might allow local root users to cause a denial of service or gain privileges by setting the default wakeup threshold to a value greater than the output pool size, which triggers writing random numbers to the stack by the pool transfer function involving \"bound check ordering\".  NOTE: this issue might only cross privilege boundaries in environments that have granular assignment of privileges for root.",
