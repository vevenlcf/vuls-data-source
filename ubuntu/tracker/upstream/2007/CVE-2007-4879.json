  "description": "Mozilla Firefox before Firefox 2.0.0.13, and SeaMonkey before 1.1.9, can automatically install TLS client certificates with minimal user interaction, and automatically sends these certificates when requested, which makes it easier for remote web sites to track user activities across domains by requesting the TLS client certificates from other domains.",
