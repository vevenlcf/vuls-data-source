  "candidate": "CVE-2007-3731",
  "description": "The Linux kernel 2.6.20 and 2.6.21 does not properly handle an invalid LDT segment selector in %cs (the xcs field) during ptrace single-step operations, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL dereference and OOPS) via certain code that makes ptrace PTRACE_SETREGS and PTRACE_SINGLESTEP requests, related to the TRACE_IRQS_ON function, and possibly related to the arch_ptrace function.",
  "ubuntu_description": "Evan Teran discovered that the Linux kernel ptrace routines did not correctly handle certain requests robustly. Local attackers could exploit this to crash the system, causing a denial of service",
