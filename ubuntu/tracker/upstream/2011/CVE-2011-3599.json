{
  "candidate": "CVE-2011-3599",
  "description": "The Crypt::DSA (aka Crypt-DSA) module 1.17 and earlier for Perl, when /dev/random is absent, uses the Data::Random module, which makes it easier for remote attackers to spoof a signature, or determine the signing key of a signed message, via a brute-force attack.",
  "notes": {
    "sbeattie": "all our kernels have /dev/random on them, thus not affected by fallback code"
  },
