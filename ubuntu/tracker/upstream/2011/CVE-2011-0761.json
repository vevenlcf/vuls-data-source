  "candidate": "CVE-2011-0761",
  "description": "Perl 5.10.x allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and application crash) by leveraging an ability to inject arguments into a (1) getpeername, (2) readdir, (3) closedir, (4) getsockname, (5) rewinddir, (6) tell, or (7) telldir function call.",
  "notes": {
    "sbeattie": "toucan systems advisory has PoC",
    "seth-arnold": "ignoring this CVE: flaw requires extremely poorly written software to exploit the problem (allow input to modify the number of arguments to fundamental functions), crashes do not appear to be under argument control. Upstream Perl team does not consider it a security-relevant problem and thus have not prepared any patches."
