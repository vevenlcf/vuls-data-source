  "candidate": "CVE-2011-0726",
  "description": "The do_task_stat function in fs/proc/array.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.39-rc1 does not perform an expected uid check, which makes it easier for local users to defeat the ASLR protection mechanism by reading the start_code and end_code fields in the /proc/#####/stat file for a process executing a PIE binary.",
  "ubuntu_description": "Kees Cook reported that /proc/pid/stat did not correctly filter certain memory locations. A local attacker could determine the memory layout of processes in an attempt to increase the chances of a successful memory corruption exploit.",
