  "candidate": "CVE-2011-1079",
  "description": "The bnep_sock_ioctl function in net/bluetooth/bnep/sock.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.39 does not ensure that a certain device field ends with a '\\0' character, which allows local users to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel stack memory, or cause a denial of service (BUG and system crash), via a BNEPCONNADD command.",
  "ubuntu_description": "Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that the Bluetooth stack did not correctly check that device name strings were NULL terminated. A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of service, or leak contents of kernel stack memory, leading to a loss of privacy.",
