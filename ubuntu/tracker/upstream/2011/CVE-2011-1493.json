  "candidate": "CVE-2011-1493",
  "description": "Array index error in the rose_parse_national function in net/rose/rose_subr.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.39 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact by composing FAC_NATIONAL_DIGIS data that specifies a large number of digipeaters, and then sending this data to a ROSE socket.",
  "ubuntu_description": "Dan Rosenberg discovered that the X.25 Rose network stack did not correctly handle certain fields. If a system was running with Rose enabled, a remote attacker could send specially crafted traffic to gain root privileges.",
  "notes": {
    "kees": "e0bccd315db0c2f919e7fcf9cb60db21d9986f52 will likely end up in its own CVE in the future."
