  "candidate": "CVE-2010-4478",
  "description": "OpenSSH 5.6 and earlier, when J-PAKE is enabled, does not properly validate the public parameters in the J-PAKE protocol, which allows remote attackers to bypass the need for knowledge of the shared secret, and successfully authenticate, by sending crafted values in each round of the protocol, a related issue to CVE-2010-4252.",
  "notes": {
    "sbeattie": "openssh in karmic and prior does not include J-PAKE auth support; in lucid and maverick it's present but not enabled at compile time. Added a QRT regression test that looks for client-side support."
