  "candidate": "CVE-2010-3192",
  "description": "Certain run-time memory protection mechanisms in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) print argv[0] and backtrace information, which might allow context-dependent attackers to obtain sensitive information from process memory by executing an incorrect program, as demonstrated by a setuid program that contains a stack-based buffer overflow error, related to the __fortify_fail function in debug/fortify_fail.c, and the __stack_chk_fail (aka stack protection) and __chk_fail (aka FORTIFY_SOURCE) implementations.",
  "notes": {
    "mdeslaur": "upstream has closed this bug as \"won't fix\". Let's ignore this.",
    "tyhicks": "upstream has now fixed this CVE so I'm un-ignoring it. We need to verify but we don't think we are vulnerable as we're already disabling the stack trace."
