  "description": "The wait_for_child_to_die function in main/event.c in FreeRADIUS 2.1.x before 2.1.10, in certain circumstances involving long-term database outages, does not properly handle long queue times for requests, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) by sending many requests.",
