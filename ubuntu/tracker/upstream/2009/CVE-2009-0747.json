  "candidate": "CVE-2009-0747",
  "description": "The ext4_isize function in fs/ext4/ext4.h in the Linux kernel 2.6.27 before 2.6.27.19 and 2.6.28 before 2.6.28.7 uses the i_size_high structure member during operations on arbitrary types of files, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption and error-message flood) by attempting to mount a crafted ext4 filesystem.",
  "ubuntu_description": "The ext4 filesystem did not correctly validate certain type fields.  A local attacker could mount a malicious ext4 filesystem, causing a system crash, leading to a denial of service.",
