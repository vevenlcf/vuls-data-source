  "candidate": "CVE-2009-2473",
  "description": "neon before 0.28.6, when expat is used, does not properly detect recursion during entity expansion, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (memory and CPU consumption) via a crafted XML document containing a large number of nested entity references, a similar issue to CVE-2003-1564.",

    "jdstrand": "neon, neon26 and neon27 are all build with libxml2 and not expat"
