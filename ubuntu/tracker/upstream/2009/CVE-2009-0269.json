  "description": "fs/ecryptfs/inode.c in the eCryptfs subsystem in the Linux kernel before 2.6.28.1 allows local users to cause a denial of service (fault or memory corruption), or possibly have unspecified other impact, via a readlink call that results in an error, leading to use of a -1 return value as an array index.",
