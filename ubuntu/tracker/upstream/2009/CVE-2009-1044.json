  "candidate": "CVE-2009-1044",
  "description": "Mozilla Firefox 3.0.7 on Windows 7 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via unknown vectors related to the _moveToEdgeShift XUL tree method, which triggers garbage collection on objects that are still in use, as demonstrated by Nils during a PWN2OWN competition at CanSecWest 2009.",
  "notes": {
    "jdstrand": "CVEs in Firefox are tracked in the xulrunner source packages. The mapping of xulrunner sources to firefox is: xulrunner (1.8.0): firefox (1.5) - Ubuntu 6.06 LTS xulrunner (1.8.1): firefox (2.0) - Ubuntu 6.10 - 8.04 LTS xulrunner-1.9: firefox-3.0 xulrunner-1.9.1: firefox-3.5 Ubuntu 6.06 LTS and 10.04 LTS uses the embedded xulrunner and not the system xulrunner-1.9.2, so it is tracked in the firefox source package.",
