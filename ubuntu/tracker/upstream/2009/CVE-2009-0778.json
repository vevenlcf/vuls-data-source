  "candidate": "CVE-2009-0778",
  "description": "The icmp_send function in net/ipv4/icmp.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.25, when configured as a router with a REJECT route, does not properly manage the Protocol Independent Destination Cache (aka DST) in some situations involving transmission of an ICMP Host Unreachable message, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (connectivity outage) by sending a large series of packets to many destination IP addresses within this REJECT route, related to an \"rt_cache leak.\"",
  "notes": {
    "smb": "The commit which (according to the commit message) introduced the problem was in v2.6.25-rc1, the fix in v2.6.25-rc8. So Dapper and Hardy are not affected."
