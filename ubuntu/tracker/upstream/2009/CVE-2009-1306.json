  "candidate": "CVE-2009-1306",
  "description": "The jar: URI implementation in Mozilla Firefox before 3.0.9, Thunderbird, and SeaMonkey does not follow the Content-Disposition header of the inner URI, which allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks and possibly other attacks via an uploaded .jar file with a \"Content-Disposition: attachment\" designation.",
  "notes": {
    "jdstrand": "CVEs in Firefox are tracked in the xulrunner source packages. The mapping of xulrunner sources to firefox is: xulrunner (1.8.0): firefox (1.5) - Ubuntu 6.06 LTS xulrunner (1.8.1): firefox (2.0) - Ubuntu 6.10 - 8.04 LTS xulrunner-1.9: firefox-3.0 xulrunner-1.9.1: firefox-3.5 Ubuntu 6.06 LTS and 10.04 LTS uses the embedded xulrunner and not the system xulrunner-1.9.2, so it is tracked in the firefox source package."
