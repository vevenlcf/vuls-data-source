  "candidate": "CVE-2009-0834",
  "description": "The audit_syscall_entry function in the Linux kernel 2.6.28.7 and earlier on the x86_64 platform does not properly handle (1) a 32-bit process making a 64-bit syscall or (2) a 64-bit process making a 32-bit syscall, which allows local users to bypass certain syscall audit configurations via crafted syscalls, a related issue to CVE-2009-0342 and CVE-2009-0343.",
  "ubuntu_description": "The syscall interface did not correctly validate parameters when crossing the 64-bit/32-bit boundary.  A local attacker could bypass certain syscall restricts via crafted syscalls.",
