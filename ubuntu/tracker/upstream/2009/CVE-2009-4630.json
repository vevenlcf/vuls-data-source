  "candidate": "CVE-2009-4630",
  "description": "Mozilla Necko, as used in Firefox, SeaMonkey, and other applications, performs DNS prefetching of domain names contained in links within local HTML documents, which makes it easier for remote attackers to determine the network location of the application's user by logging DNS requests.  NOTE: the vendor disputes the significance of this issue, stating \"I don't think we necessarily need to worry about that case.\"",
  "notes": {
    "jdstrand": "CVEs in Firefox are tracked in the xulrunner source packages. The mapping of xulrunner sources to firefox is: xulrunner (1.8.0): firefox (1.5) - Ubuntu 6.06 LTS xulrunner (1.8.1): firefox (2.0) - Ubuntu 6.10 - 8.04 LTS xulrunner-1.9: firefox-3.0 xulrunner-1.9.1: firefox-3.5 Ubuntu 6.06 LTS and 10.04 LTS uses the embedded xulrunner and not the system xulrunner-1.9.2, so it is tracked in the firefox source package."
