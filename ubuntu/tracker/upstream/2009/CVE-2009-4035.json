  "description": "The FoFiType1::parse function in fofi/FoFiType1.cc in Xpdf 3.0.0, gpdf 2.8.2, kpdf in kdegraphics 3.3.1, and possibly other libraries and versions, does not check the return value of the getNextLine function, which allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via a PDF file with a crafted Type 1 font that can produce a negative value, leading to a signed-to-unsigned integer conversion error and a buffer overflow.",
