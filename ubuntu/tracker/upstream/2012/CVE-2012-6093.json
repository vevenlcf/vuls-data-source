  "candidate": "CVE-2012-6093",
  "description": "The QSslSocket::sslErrors function in Qt before 4.6.5, 4.7.x before 4.7.6, 4.8.x before 4.8.5, when using certain versions of openSSL, uses an \"incompatible structure layout\" that can read memory from the wrong location, which causes Qt to report an incorrect error when certificate validation fails and might cause users to make unsafe security decisions to accept a certificate.",
  "notes": {
    "mdeslaur": "this is only an issue in environments where a different version of openssl is loaded at runtime than the one used during compilation. This shouldn't happen on Ubuntu, as it should be using the openssl version in the archive. Downgrading priority to \"low\"."
