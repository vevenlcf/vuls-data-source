  "description": "The resolver in ISC BIND 9 through 9.8.1-P1 overwrites cached server names and TTL values in NS records during the processing of a response to an A record query, which allows remote attackers to trigger continued resolvability of revoked domain names via a \"ghost domain names\" attack.",

    "mdeslaur": "upstream advisory says they won't be releasing a fix for this dns-sec is the workaround. upstream apparently included the fix anyway: 3282. [bug] Restrict the TTL of NS RRset to no more than that of the old NS RRset when replacing it. [RT #27792] [RT #27884]"
