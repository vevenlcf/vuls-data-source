  "description": "SQL injection vulnerability in mod_auth_mysql.c in the mod-auth-mysql (aka libapache2-mod-auth-mysql) module for the Apache HTTP Server 2.x, when configured to use a multibyte character set that allows a \\ (backslash) as part of the character encoding, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via unspecified inputs in a login request.",
  "notes": {
    "mdeslaur": "Specifying an encoding was introduced by the 012-charset.dpatch patch in 4.3.9-10. Since we don't support specifying an encoding mysql won't decode the username and injection is not possible."
