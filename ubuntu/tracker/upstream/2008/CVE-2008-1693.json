  "candidate": "CVE-2008-1693",
  "description": "The CairoFont::create function in CairoFontEngine.cc in Poppler, possibly before 0.8.0, as used in Xpdf, Evince, ePDFview, KWord, and other applications, does not properly handle embedded fonts in PDF files, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted font object, related to dereferencing a function pointer associated with the type of this font object.",
  "notes": {
    "fujitsu": "libextractor isn't affected by the main CairoFont vulnerability.",
    "kees": "there are two issues -- the specific vulnerability in embedded fonts and the fact that the Object types are unchecked when calling union member functions."
