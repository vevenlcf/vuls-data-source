  "candidate": "CVE-2008-3272",
  "description": "The snd_seq_oss_synth_make_info function in sound/core/seq/oss/seq_oss_synth.c in the sound subsystem in the Linux kernel before 2.6.27-rc2 does not verify that the device number is within the range defined by max_synthdev before returning certain data to the caller, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information.",
  "ubuntu_description": "Tobias Klein discovered that the OSS interface through ALSA did not correctly validate the device number.  A local attacker could exploit this to access sensitive kernel memory, leading to a denial of service or a loss of privacy.",
