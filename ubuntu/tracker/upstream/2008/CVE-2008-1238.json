  "description": "Mozilla Firefox before 2.0.0.13 and SeaMonkey before 1.1.9, when generating the HTTP Referer header, does not list the entire URL when it contains Basic Authentication credentials without a username, which makes it easier for remote attackers to bypass application protection mechanisms that rely on Referer headers, such as with some Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) mechanisms.",
