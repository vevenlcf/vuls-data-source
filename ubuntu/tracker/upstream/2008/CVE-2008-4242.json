  "candidate": "CVE-2008-4242",
  "description": "ProFTPD 1.3.1 interprets long commands from an FTP client as multiple commands, which allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks and execute arbitrary FTP commands via a long ftp:// URI that leverages an existing session from the FTP client implementation in a web browser.",
  "notes": {
    "stefanlsd": "After discussion with Francesco Paolo Lovergine \u003cfrankie@debian.org\u003e we concluded that this bug does not affect the Debian or Ubuntu versions of proftpd 1.3.1 or earlier. We believe the problems that this CVE affects were only introduced in the proftpd 1.3.2rc series. The exploit as found in the Bugs section was independently tested and shown to not apply."
