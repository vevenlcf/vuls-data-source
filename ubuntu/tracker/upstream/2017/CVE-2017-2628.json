  "description": "curl, as shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 before version 7.19.7-53, did not correctly backport the fix for CVE-2015-3148 because it did not reflect the fact that the HAVE_GSSAPI define was meanwhile substituted by USE_HTTP_NEGOTIATE. This issue was introduced in RHEL 6.7 and affects RHEL 6 curl only.",
  "notes": {
    "mdeslaur": "Is an issue in Red Hat's backport as their old version doesn't have USE_HTTP_NEGOTIATE. Doesn't affect precise and newer."
