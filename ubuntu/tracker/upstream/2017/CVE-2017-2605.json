  "description": "** REJECT **  DO NOT USE THIS CANDIDATE NUMBER. ConsultIDs: CVE-2017-1000362. Reason: This candidate is a duplicate of CVE-2017-1000362.  A vendor reference identifier was mistakenly treated as a CVE ID. Notes: All CVE users should reference CVE-2017-1000362 instead of this candidate.  All references and descriptions in this candidate have been removed to prevent accidental usage. Jenkins now deletes the backup directory, if present. Upgrading from before 1.498 will no longer create a backup directory. Administrators relying on file access permissions in their manually created backups are advised to check them for the directory $JENKINS_HOME/jenkins.security.RekeySecretAdminMonitor/backups, and delete it if present.",
