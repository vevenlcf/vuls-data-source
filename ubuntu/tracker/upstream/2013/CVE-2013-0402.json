  "description": "Heap-based buffer overflow in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) component in Oracle Java SE 7 Update 17 and earlier and JavaFX 2.2.7 and earlier allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors related to JavaFX, as demonstrated by VUPEN during a Pwn2Own competition at CanSecWest 2013.",
  "notes": {
    "mdeslaur": "fixed in 7u21. Likely in JavaFX, so openjdk wasn't vulnerable."
