  "candidate": "CVE-2013-2213",
  "description": "The KRandom::random function in KDE Paste Applet after 4.10.5 in kdeplasma-addons uses the GNU C Library rand function's linear congruential generator, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to defeat cryptographic protection mechanisms by predicting the generator output.",
  "notes": {
    "seth-arnold": "This CVE is for an incomplete fix for CVE-2013-2120, which means that it only really applies to packages where the upstream fix for CVE-2013-2120 was used. I believe that is only raring-proposed as of 2013-06-26, but I'm marking this needed for all releases, to ensure the incorrect fix is not used alone."
