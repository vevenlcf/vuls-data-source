  "candidate": "CVE-2013-6419",
  "description": "Interaction error in OpenStack Nova and Neutron before Havana 2013.2.1 and icehouse-1 does not validate the instance ID of the tenant making a request, which allows remote tenants to obtain sensitive metadata by spoofing the device ID that is bound to a port, which is not properly handled by (1) api/metadata/handler.py in Nova and (2) the neutron-metadata-agent (agent/metadata/agent.py) in Neutron.",
  "notes": {
    "jdstrand": "requires updating both nova and neutron. Ubuntu 13.04 and lower do not have neutron in the archive, so ignoring requires instance_id to be exposed to attacker",
