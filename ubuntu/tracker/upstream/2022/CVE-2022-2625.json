  "candidate": "CVE-2022-2625",
  "description": "A vulnerability found in postgresql. On this security issue an attack requires permission to create non-temporary objects in at least one schema, ability to lure or wait for an administrator to create or update an affected extension in that schema, and ability to lure or wait for a victim to use the object targeted in CREATE OR REPLACE or CREATE IF NOT EXISTS. Given all three prerequisites, the attacker can run arbitrary code as the victim role, which may be a superuser. Known-affected extensions include both PostgreSQL-bundled and non-bundled extensions. PostgreSQL blocks this attack in the core server, so there's no need to modify individual extensions.",
