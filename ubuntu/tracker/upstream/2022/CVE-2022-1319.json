  "candidate": "CVE-2022-1319",
  "description": "For an AJP 400 response, EAP 7 is improperly sending two response packets and those 'END RESPONSE' packets have the reuse flag set even though JBoss does close the connection. So when httpd reuses that connection after a 400 for something like a cping, it will receive a failure since it reads in the second SEND_HEADERS response packet instead of a CPONG.",
