  "candidate": "CVE-2014-4039",
  "description": "ppc64-diag 2.6.1 uses 0775 permissions for /tmp/diagSEsnap and does not properly restrict permissions for /tmp/diagSEsnap/snapH.tar.gz, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information by reading files in this archive, as demonstrated by /var/log/messages and /etc/yaboot.conf.",
  "notes": {
    "sbeattie": "in trusty, powerpc-utils does not contain the snap script, so no file generated in yakkety and newer, powerpc-utils dropped the snap script, so no file generated there; yakkety has a patch applied by debian to adjust the directory permissions as well, but it's a moot point. in xenial, the snap script refuses to run on Ubuntu, due to not supporting the distro, and again won't create the file."
