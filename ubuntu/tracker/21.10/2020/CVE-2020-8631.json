  "candidate": "CVE-2020-8631",
  "description": "cloud-init through 19.4 relies on Mersenne Twister for a random password, which makes it easier for attackers to predict passwords, because rand_str in cloudinit/util.py calls the random.choice function.",
  "notes": {
    "ccdm94": "This CVE has been patched in Xenial ESM. The patch, however, has been added only to the updates pocket, and since cloud-init is only used during first boot (pulling from updates), there should not be a need to add this to the security pocket."
