  "description": "Subversion's mod_dav_svn is vulnerable to memory corruption. While looking up path-based authorization rules, mod_dav_svn servers may attempt to use memory which has already been freed. Affected Subversion mod_dav_svn servers 1.10.0 through 1.14.1 (inclusive). Servers that do not use mod_dav_svn are not affected.",
  "ubuntu_description": "Thomas Weißschuh discovered that subversion servers did not properly handle memory in certain configurations. A remote attacker could potentially use this issue to cause a denial of service or other unspecified impact.",
