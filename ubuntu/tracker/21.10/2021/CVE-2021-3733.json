  "candidate": "CVE-2021-3733",
  "description": "There's a flaw in urllib's AbstractBasicAuthHandler class. An attacker who controls a malicious HTTP server that an HTTP client (such as web browser) connects to, could trigger a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDOS) during an authentication request with a specially crafted payload that is sent by the server to the client. The greatest threat that this flaw poses is to application availability.",

    "leosilva": "code affected in hirsute and devel is already patched, so both releases in python3.9 are not affected."
