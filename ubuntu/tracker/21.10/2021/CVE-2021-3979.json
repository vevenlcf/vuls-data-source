  "candidate": "CVE-2021-3979",
  "description": "A key length flaw was found in Red Hat Ceph Storage. An attacker can exploit the fact that the key length is incorrectly passed in an encryption algorithm to create a non random key, which is weaker and can be exploited for loss of confidentiality and integrity on encrypted disks.",
  "notes": {
    "mdeslaur": "This is fixed in 15.2.16-0ubuntu0.20.04.1 in focal-updates, but is not yet in focal-security."
