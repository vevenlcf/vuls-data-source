{
  "candidate": "CVE-2015-2808",
  "description": "The RC4 algorithm, as used in the TLS protocol and SSL protocol, does not properly combine state data with key data during the initialization phase, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct plaintext-recovery attacks against the initial bytes of a stream by sniffing network traffic that occasionally relies on keys affected by the Invariance Weakness, and then using a brute-force approach involving LSB values, aka the \"Bar Mitzvah\" issue.",
  "notes": {
    "tyhicks": "This is an RC4 protocol flaw and it is not specific to an Ubuntu package"
