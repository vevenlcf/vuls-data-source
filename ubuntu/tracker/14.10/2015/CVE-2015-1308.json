  "description": "kde-workspace 4.2.0 and plasma-workspace before 5.1.95 allows remote attackers to obtain input events, and consequently obtain passwords, by leveraging access to the X server when the screen is locked.",
  "notes": {
    "mdeslaur": "under X, apps can pretty much sniff input events anyway",
    "tsimonq2": "The only release that is affected by this is Trusty, and upstream recommends against backporting a fix (it's low priority anyways) Reference: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1183710#c5"
