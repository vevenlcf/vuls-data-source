  "candidate": "CVE-2012-2677",
  "description": "Integer overflow in the ordered_malloc function in boost/pool/pool.hpp in Boost Pool before 3.9 makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to perform memory-related attacks such as buffer overflows via a large memory chunk size value, which causes less memory to be allocated than expected.",
  "notes": {
    "mdeslaur": "commit 78337 should also be checked. fix is still only in -sandbox repo, and not in trunk or release branches. 1.50 came out without it. vulnerability is in .hpp files, so anything built with boost/pool needs to be rebuilt. only ceph and mdds are in main and use boost/pool/pool.* don't seem to be directly affected. Downgrading to low."
