  "candidate": "CVE-2008-3067",
  "description": "sudo in SUSE openSUSE 10.3 does not clear the stdin buffer when password entry times out, which might allow local users to obtain a password by reading stdin from the parent process after a sudo child process exits.",
  "notes": {
    "kees": "could not reproduce on Dapper or Gutsy, which predated the patch. I think this is a stand-alone vs PAM issue, and Debian/Ubuntu uses PAM."
