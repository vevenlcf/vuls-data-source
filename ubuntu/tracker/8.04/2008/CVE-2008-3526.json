  "candidate": "CVE-2008-3526",
  "description": "Integer overflow in the sctp_setsockopt_auth_key function in net/sctp/socket.c in the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (sctp) implementation in the Linux kernel 2.6.24-rc1 through 2.6.26.3 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (panic) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted sca_keylength field associated with the SCTP_AUTH_KEY option.",
  "ubuntu_description": "It was discovered that the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) did not correctly validate the key length in the SCTP_AUTH_KEY option. If SCTP is in use, a remote attacker could send specially crafted network traffic that would crash the system, leading to a denial of service.",
