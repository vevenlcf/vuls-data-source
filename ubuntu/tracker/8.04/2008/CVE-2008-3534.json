  "candidate": "CVE-2008-3534",
  "description": "The shmem_delete_inode function in mm/shmem.c in the tmpfs implementation in the Linux kernel before 2.6.26.1 allows local users to cause a denial of service (system crash) via a certain sequence of file create, remove, and overwrite operations, as demonstrated by the insserv program, related to allocation of \"useless pages\" and improper maintenance of the i_blocks count.",
  "ubuntu_description": "It was discovered that the tmpfs implementation did not correctly handle certain sequences of inode operations.  A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of service.",
