  "candidate": "CVE-2008-5713",
  "description": "The __qdisc_run function in net/sched/sch_generic.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.25 on SMP machines allows local users to cause a denial of service (soft lockup) by sending a large amount of network traffic, as demonstrated by multiple simultaneous invocations of the Netperf benchmark application in UDP_STREAM mode.",
  "ubuntu_description": "It was discovered that in certain situations the network scheduler did not correctly handle very large levels of traffic.  A local attacker could produce a high volume of UDP traffic resulting in a system hang, leading to a denial of service.",
