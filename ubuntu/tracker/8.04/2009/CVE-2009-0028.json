  "candidate": "CVE-2009-0028",
  "description": "The clone system call in the Linux kernel 2.6.28 and earlier allows local users to send arbitrary signals to a parent process from an unprivileged child process by launching an additional child process with the CLONE_PARENT flag, and then letting this new process exit.",
  "ubuntu_description": "In certain situations, cloned processes were able to send signals to parent processes, crossing privilege boundaries.  A local attacker could send arbitrary signals to parent processes, leading to a denial of service.",
