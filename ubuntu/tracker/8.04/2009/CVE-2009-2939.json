{
  "candidate": "CVE-2009-2939",
  "description": "The postfix.postinst script in the Debian GNU/Linux and Ubuntu postfix 2.5.5 package grants the postfix user write access to /var/spool/postfix/pid, which might allow local users to conduct symlink attacks that overwrite arbitrary files.",
  "notes": {
    "jdstrand": "per Weitse, the symlink attack should not be possible due to defensive programming. A subverted postfix process running as 'postfix' could replace the pid file, which master could then send signals to."
