  "notes": {
    "mdeslaur": "This is XSA-15 only 4.0 and higher ONLY installations where \"tmem\" is specified on the hypervisor command line are vulnerable.  Most Xen installations do not do so. upstream says: \"TMEM has been described by its maintainers as a technology preview, and is therefore not supported by them for use in production systems. Pending a full security audit of the code, the Xen.org security team recommends that Xen users do not enable TMEM.\" We will not be fixing this in Ubuntu. Marking as \"ignored\""
