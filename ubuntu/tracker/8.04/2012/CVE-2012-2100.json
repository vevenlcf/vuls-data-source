  "candidate": "CVE-2012-2100",
  "description": "The ext4_fill_flex_info function in fs/ext4/super.c in the Linux kernel before 3.2.2, on the x86 platform and unspecified other platforms, allows user-assisted remote attackers to trigger inconsistent filesystem-groups data and possibly cause a denial of service via a malformed ext4 filesystem containing a super block with a large FLEX_BG group size (aka s_log_groups_per_flex value).  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2009-4307.",
  "ubuntu_description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's ext4 file system when mounting a corrupt filesystem. A user-assisted remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service.",
  "notes": {
    "apw": "although the description indicates only PPC is affected, my reading of the patch commentary might well say its only PPC which is not affected",
    "jj": "looking at this PPC is one of the few architectures where the original patch for CVE-2009-4307 actually worked. It does not on x86 nor on the clang compiler which optimizes away the check hence, the new CVE and patch"
