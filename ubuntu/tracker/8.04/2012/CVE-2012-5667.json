  "description": "Multiple integer overflows in GNU Grep before 2.11 might allow context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via vectors involving a long input line that triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.",
  "notes": {
    "jdstrand": "Reproducer for amd64 system (tested with 8G of RAM): Ubuntu 8.04 LTS - 12.04 LTS confirmed to be affected. Each release segfaults. Ubuntu 12.10+ does not segfault RedHat bug has a reduced proposed patch that simply performs boundary checking but it has not been commented on as of 2013/05/07 This is arguably of low priority unless code-execution can be demonstrated",
