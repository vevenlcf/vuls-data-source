  "candidate": "CVE-2010-3567",
  "description": "Unspecified vulnerability in the 2D component in Oracle Java SE and Java for Business 6 Update 21, and 5.0 Update 25 allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability via unknown vectors. NOTE: the previous information was obtained from the October 2010 CPU. Oracle has not commented on claims from a reliable downstream vendor that this is related to a calculation error in right-to-left text character counts for the ICU OpenType font rendering implementation, which triggers an out-of-bounds memory access.",
  "ubuntu_description": "It was discovered that a miscalculation in the OpenType font rendering implementation would allow out-of-bounds memory access. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running a java application.",
