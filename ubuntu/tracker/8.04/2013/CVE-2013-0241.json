  "candidate": "CVE-2013-0241",
  "description": "The QXL display driver in QXL Virtual GPU 0.1.0 allows local users to cause a denial of service (guest crash or hang) via a SPICE connection that prevents other threads from obtaining the qemu_mutex mutex.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.",
  "notes": {
    "mdeslaur": "needs qemu-kvm patch (included in 1.0) http://git.kernel.org/?p=virt/kvm/qemu-kvm.git;a=commit;h=5ff4e36c oneiric and precise don't have spice enabled in the qemu-kvm build. This probably only has an impact in environments where a precise guest is running on a host with spice enabled, and recent enough to supports async io. Downgrading priority to low."
