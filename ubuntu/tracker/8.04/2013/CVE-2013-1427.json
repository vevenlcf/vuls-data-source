  "candidate": "CVE-2013-1427",
  "description": "The configuration file for the FastCGI PHP support for lighttpd before 1.4.28 on Debian GNU/Linux creates a socket file with a predictable name in /tmp, which allows local users to hijack the PHP control socket and perform unauthorized actions such as forcing the use of a different version of PHP via a symlink attack or a race condition.",

    "jdstrand": "socket file was /tmp/php.socket. This should be protected by symlink restrictions in Ubuntu 11.10 and higher"
