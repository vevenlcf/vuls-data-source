  "candidate": "CVE-2013-1591",
  "description": "Stack-based buffer overflow in libpixman, as used in Pale Moon before 15.4 and possibly other products, has unspecified impact and context-dependent attack vectors.  NOTE: this issue might be resultant from an integer overflow in the fast_composite_scaled_bilinear function in pixman-inlines.h, which triggers an infinite loop.",
