  "candidate": "CVE-2013-1766",
  "description": "libvirt 1.0.2 and earlier sets the group owner to kvm for device files, which allows local users to write to these files via unspecified vectors.",
  "notes": {
    "jdstrand": "Debian bug reports states this is a problem because the kvm group is a general-purpose group and therefore changing device group ownership exposes these devices to other groups on the system. The kvm group on Ubuntu has been used since Ubuntu 10.10. Debian's solution is to update the packaging to add a new libvirt-qemu groupi, have the libvirt-qemu user be in the libvirt-qemu group as a secondary group, then use as a configure option: --with-qemu-group=libvirt-qemu. This is too intrusive for a stable release for an arguably marginal security gain."
