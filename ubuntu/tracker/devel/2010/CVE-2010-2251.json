  "candidate": "CVE-2010-2251",
  "description": "The get1 command, as used by lftpget, in LFTP before 4.0.6 does not properly validate a server-provided filename before determining the destination filename of a download, which allows remote servers to create or overwrite arbitrary files via a Content-Disposition header that suggests a crafted filename, and possibly execute arbitrary code as a consequence of writing to a dotfile in a home directory.",
  "notes": {
    "mdeslaur": "dapper's lftp is too old to support server-suggested filenames"
