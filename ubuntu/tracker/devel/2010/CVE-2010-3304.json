  "description": "The ACL plugin in Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.13 propagates INBOX ACLs to newly created mailboxes in certain configurations, which might allow remote attackers to read mailboxes that have unintended weak ACLs.",
  "notes": {
    "mdeslaur": "upstream says only 1.2.x, but code is present in at least as far back as jaunty. Code doesn't look affected in hardy and earlier. Couldn't reproduce on karmic, so not-affected."
