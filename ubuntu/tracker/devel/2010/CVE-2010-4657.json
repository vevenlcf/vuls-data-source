    "mdeslaur": "can't reproduce on quantal+ The reproducer only displays garbage if the suhosin patch is applied, which is why it doesn't appear to work on quantal+ Need to check if libxml2 still walks past the end of the string if the suhosin patch isn't applied. we will not be fixing this issue"
