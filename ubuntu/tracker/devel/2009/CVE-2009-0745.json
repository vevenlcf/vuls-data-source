  "candidate": "CVE-2009-0745",
  "description": "The ext4_group_add function in fs/ext4/resize.c in the Linux kernel 2.6.27 before 2.6.27.19 and 2.6.28 before 2.6.28.7 does not properly initialize the group descriptor during a resize (aka resize2fs) operation, which might allow local users to cause a denial of service (OOPS) by arranging for crafted values to be present in available memory.",
  "ubuntu_description": "The ext4 filesystem did not correctly clear group descriptors when resizing. A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of service.",
