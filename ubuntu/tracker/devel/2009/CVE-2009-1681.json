  "description": "WebKit in Apple Safari before 4.0, iPhone OS 1.0 through 2.2.1, and iPhone OS for iPod touch 1.1 through 2.2.1 does not prevent web sites from loading third-party content into a subframe, which allows remote attackers to bypass the Same Origin Policy and conduct \"clickjacking\" attacks via a crafted HTML document.",
  "notes": {
    "jdstrand": "webkit is a fork of khtml from kdelibs. kdelibs5 is farther from it, while qt4-x11 attempts to unify khtml and webkit",
    "mdeslaur": "code doesn't seem present in kdelibs. this code implements X-FRAME-OPTIONS (in ie8, not in firefox) this is new functionality"
