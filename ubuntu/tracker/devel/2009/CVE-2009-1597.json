  "candidate": "CVE-2009-1597",
  "description": "Mozilla Firefox executes DOM calls in response to a javascript: URI in the target attribute of a submit element within a form contained in an inline PDF file, which might allow remote attackers to bypass intended Adobe Acrobat JavaScript restrictions on accessing the document object, as demonstrated by a web site that permits PDF uploads by untrusted users, and therefore has a shared document.domain between the web site and this javascript: URI.  NOTE: the researcher reports that Adobe's position is \"a PDF file is active content.\"",

    "jdstrand": "Requires inline PDF with acroread. PDF is active content, ignoring until upstream has more information."
