  "candidate": "CVE-2009-0029",
  "description": "The ABI in the Linux kernel 2.6.28 and earlier on s390, powerpc, sparc64, and mips 64-bit platforms requires that a 32-bit argument in a 64-bit register was properly sign extended when sent from a user-mode application, but cannot verify this, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly gain privileges via a crafted system call.",
  "ubuntu_description": "The 64-bit syscall interfaces did not correctly handle sign extension. A local attacker could make malicious syscalls, possibly gaining root privileges.  The x86_64 architecture was not affected.",
