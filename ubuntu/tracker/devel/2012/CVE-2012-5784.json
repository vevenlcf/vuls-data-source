  "description": "Apache Axis 1.4 and earlier, as used in PayPal Payments Pro, PayPal Mass Pay, PayPal Transactional Information SOAP, the Java Message Service implementation in Apache ActiveMQ, and other products, does not verify that the server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) or subjectAltName field of the X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers via an arbitrary valid certificate.",

    "jdstrand": "if fixing this, also fix CVE-2014-3596",
    "mdeslaur": "debian 1.4-16.1 has a possible regression. Nothing in the main archive seems to be directly affected by this, and changing it now may introduce failures in certain environments where the CN doesn't match the hostname. Downgrading priority to \"low\""
