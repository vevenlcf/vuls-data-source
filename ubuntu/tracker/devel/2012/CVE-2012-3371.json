{
  "candidate": "CVE-2012-3371",
  "description": "The Nova scheduler in OpenStack Compute (Nova) Folsom (2012.2) and Essex (2012.1), when DifferentHostFilter or SameHostFilter is enabled, allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (excessive database lookup calls and server hang) via a request with many repeated IDs in the os:scheduler_hints section. Dan Prince from Red Hat reported a vulnerability in Nova scheduler nodes. By creating servers with malicious scheduler_hints, an authenticated user may generate a huge amount of database calls, potentially resulting in a Denial of Service attack against Nova scheduler nodes. Only setups exposing the OpenStack API and enabling DifferentHostFilter and/or SameHostFilter are affected.",
