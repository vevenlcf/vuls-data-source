  "candidate": "CVE-2012-0840",
  "description": "tables/apr_hash.c in the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) library through 1.4.5 computes hash values without restricting the ability to trigger hash collisions predictably, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via crafted input to an application that maintains a hash table.",
  "notes": {
    "mdeslaur": "from oss-security: \"r1231605 and r1231858 cause massive regressions and test case failures in httpd.\" (These were subsequently reverted) CVE was asked to be cancelled: http://www.mail-archive.com/dev%40apr.apache.org/msg24609.html \"After extensive consultation with the security projects of various APR consumers, it's apparent that there are no actual vulnerabilities to be exploited here.\" \"These changes do not represent either a security DEFECT nor any actual security FIX.  The APR Project dis-acknowledges the assignment of CVE-2012-0840 as erroneous, and invalid.\" Downgrading priority to \"low\"."
