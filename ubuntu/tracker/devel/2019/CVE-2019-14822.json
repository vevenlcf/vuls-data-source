  "candidate": "CVE-2019-14822",
  "description": "A flaw was discovered in ibus in versions before 1.5.22 that allows any unprivileged user to monitor and send method calls to the ibus bus of another user due to a misconfiguration in the DBus server setup. A local attacker may use this flaw to intercept all keystrokes of a victim user who is using the graphical interface, change the input method engine, or modify other input related configurations of the victim user.",
  "ubuntu_description": "Simon McVittie discovered that ibus did not enforce appropriate access controls on its private D-Bus socket. A local unprivileged user who discovers the ibus socket address of another user could exploit this to capture the key strokes of the other user.",
  "notes": {
    "amurray": "The ibus D-Bus socket address contains a long random guid making discovery of this address by another user unlikely.",
    "mdeslaur": "this was reverted in 4134-2 because of a regression, see LP bug"
