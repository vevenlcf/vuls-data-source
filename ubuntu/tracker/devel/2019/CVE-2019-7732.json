  "candidate": "CVE-2019-7732",
  "description": "In Live555 0.95, a setup packet can cause a memory leak leading to DoS because, when there are multiple instances of a single field (username, realm, nonce, uri, or response), only the last instance can ever be freed.",
  "notes": {
    "ebarretto": "According to upstream: Actually, this is not a memory leak. The parameters to “parseAuthorizationHeader()” are reference parameters (to pointers). The allocated memory is passed back to the calling function, which ends up deleting them all. So, there’s no bug here."
