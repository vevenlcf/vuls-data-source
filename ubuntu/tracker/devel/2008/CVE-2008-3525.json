  "candidate": "CVE-2008-3525",
  "description": "The sbni_ioctl function in drivers/net/wan/sbni.c in the wan subsystem in the Linux kernel 2.6.26.3 does not check for the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability before processing a (1) SIOCDEVRESINSTATS, (2) SIOCDEVSHWSTATE, (3) SIOCDEVENSLAVE, or (4) SIOCDEVEMANSIPATE ioctl request, which allows local users to bypass intended capability restrictions.",
  "ubuntu_description": "It was discovered that the SBNI WAN driver did not correctly check for the NET_ADMIN capability.  A malicious local root user lacking CAP_NET_ADMIN would be able to change the WAN device configuration, leading to a denial of service.",
