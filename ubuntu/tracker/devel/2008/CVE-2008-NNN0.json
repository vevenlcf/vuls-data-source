The gs binary itself does not do this, so it is safe. checked rdepends on libgs8, libgs-esp (for multiple calls to gsapi_init_with_args, which calls gs_main_init_with_args())-- only okular from kde4graphics calls it, and does so once per instance marking as negligible because if the user has the ability to compile and run malicious code, there are far worse things that could be done dapper doesn't ship libgs-esp gs-gpl doesn't ship library packages gs-afpl doesn't ship library packages"
