  "candidate": "CVE-2008-3831",
  "description": "The i915 driver in (1) drivers/char/drm/i915_dma.c in the Linux kernel 2.6.24 on Debian GNU/Linux and (2) sys/dev/pci/drm/i915_drv.c in OpenBSD does not restrict the DRM_I915_HWS_ADDR ioctl to the Direct Rendering Manager (DRM) master, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) via a crafted ioctl call, related to absence of the DRM_MASTER and DRM_ROOT_ONLY flags in the ioctl's configuration.",
  "ubuntu_description": "It was discovered the the i915 video driver did not correctly validate memory addresses. A local attacker could exploit this to remap memory that could cause a system crash, leading to a denial of service. This issue did not affect Ubuntu 6.06 and was previous fixed for Ubuntu 7.10 and 8.04 in USN-659-1.  Ubuntu 8.10 has now been corrected as well.",
