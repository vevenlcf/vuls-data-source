  "candidate": "CVE-2008-5300",
  "description": "Linux kernel 2.6.28 allows local users to cause a denial of service (\"soft lockup\" and process loss) via a large number of sendmsg function calls, which does not block during AF_UNIX garbage collection and triggers an OOM condition, a different vulnerability than CVE-2008-5029.",
  "ubuntu_description": "Dann Frazier discovered that in certain situations sendmsg did not correctly release allocated memory.  A local attacker could exploit this to force the system to run out of free memory, leading to a denial of service.",
