  "description": "The WebRTC video-sharing feature in dom/media/MediaManager.cpp in Mozilla Firefox before 33.0, Firefox ESR 31.x before 31.2, and Thunderbird 31.x before 31.2 does not properly recognize Stop Sharing actions for videos in IFRAME elements, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information from the local camera by maintaining a session after the user tries to discontinue streaming.",
