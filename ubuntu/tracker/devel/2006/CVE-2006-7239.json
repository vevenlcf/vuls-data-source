  "description": "The _gnutls_x509_oid2mac_algorithm function in lib/gnutls_algorithms.c in GnuTLS before 1.4.2 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a crafted X.509 certificate that uses a hash algorithm that is not supported by GnuTLS, which triggers a NULL pointer dereference.",
  "notes": {
    "jdstrand": "gnutls11 doesn't have the affected code: _gnutls_x509_oid2mac_algorithm located in lib/x509/common.c which compares to #defines from x509.h, not a pointer Hardy (gnutls13) and higher already have the corrected code"
