  "candidate": "CVE-2006-0528",
  "description": "The cairo library (libcairo), as used in GNOME Evolution and possibly other products, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (persistent client crash) via an attached text file that contains \"Content-Disposition: inline\" in the header, and a very long line in the body, which causes the client to repeatedly crash until the e-mail message is manually removed, possibly due to a buffer overflow, as demonstrated using an XML attachment.",
