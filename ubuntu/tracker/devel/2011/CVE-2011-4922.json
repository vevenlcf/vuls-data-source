  "candidate": "CVE-2011-4922",
  "description": "cipher.c in the Cipher API in libpurple in Pidgin before 2.7.10 retains encryption-key data in process memory, which might allow local users to obtain sensitive information by reading a core file or other representation of memory contents. It was discovered that libpurple versions prior to 2.7.10 do not properly clear certain data structures used in libpurple/cipher.c prior to freeing. An attacker could potentially extract partial information from memory regions freed by libpurple.",
