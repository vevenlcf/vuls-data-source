  "notes": {
    "rodrigo-zaiden": "faulty code was added in version 8.2.2672, with commit b2cb6c8b, so, versions earlier than that are not affected. there is a possibility that version 8.2.2301 (commit 752fc692) is also affected, but the PoC provided didn't reproduce in this version. Anyway, at least versions prior to 8.2.2301 are not affected."
