{
  "candidate": "CVE-2022-29154",
  "description": "An issue was discovered in rsync before 3.2.5 that allows malicious remote servers to write arbitrary files inside the directories of connecting peers. The server chooses which files/directories are sent to the client. However, the rsync client performs insufficient validation of file names. A malicious rsync server (or Man-in-The-Middle attacker) can overwrite arbitrary files in the rsync client target directory and subdirectories (for example, overwrite the .ssh/authorized_keys file).",
  "notes": {
    "eslerm": "v3.2.3 and earlier require invasive backporting and argument syntax change to path.",
    "mdeslaur": "two additional commits were added later on...need to check if more go in before the official release",
    "rodrigo-zaiden": "Another commit was found to be part of the collection for this CVE. 4 in total seems to address it. The missing commit was added in historical order in the Patches section here."
