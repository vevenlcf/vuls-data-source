  "candidate": "CVE-2022-1348",
  "description": "A vulnerability was found in logrotate in how the state file is created. The state file is used to prevent parallel executions of multiple instances of logrotate by acquiring and releasing a file lock. When the state file does not exist, it is created with world-readable permission, allowing an unprivileged user to lock the state file, stopping any rotation. This flaw affects logrotate versions before 3.20.0.",
  "notes": {
    "amurray| Only affects logrotate ": "= 3.17.0",
    "mdeslaur": "Ubuntu packages build with: --with-state-file-path=/var/lib/logrotate/status but the /var/lib/logrotate directory itself is 755, so a user can get a lock on the file. See follow-up pull request with additional fix"
