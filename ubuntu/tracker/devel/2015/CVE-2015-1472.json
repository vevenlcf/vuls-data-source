  "candidate": "CVE-2015-1472",
  "description": "The ADDW macro in stdio-common/vfscanf.c in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) before 2.21 does not properly consider data-type size during memory allocation, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (buffer overflow) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a long line containing wide characters that are improperly handled in a wscanf call.",

    "mdeslaur": "fixed by any/cvs-wscanf.diff in vivid",
    "tyhicks": "Introduced by upstream commit 3f8cc204fdd0, which is not present in Lucid."
