  "notes": {
    "seth-arnold": "The announce notes are too difficult to decipher to discover which patches go with which vulnerabilities; there are also some duplicated CVEs and CVE-2013-4437 isn't even mentioned at all,, which makes me think the whole annoucement needs a salt expert to revisit and revise."
