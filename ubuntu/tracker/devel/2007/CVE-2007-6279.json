  "candidate": "CVE-2007-6279",
  "description": "Multiple double free vulnerabilities in Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC) libFLAC before 1.2.1 allow user-assisted remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via malformed (1) Seektable values or (2) Seektable Data Offsets in a .FLAC file.",
  "notes": {
    "jdstrand": "iDefense information had virtually no details, however the Ubuntu fix for CVE-2007-4619 has several seektable checks before free, so I am marking this as fixed. note that CVE-2007-4619 was very general and came out before the iDefense CVEs, so there is overlap"
