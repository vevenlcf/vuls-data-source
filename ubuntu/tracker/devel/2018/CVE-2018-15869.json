  "candidate": "CVE-2018-15869",
  "description": "An Amazon Web Services (AWS) developer who does not specify the --owners flag when describing images via AWS CLI, and therefore not properly validating source software per AWS recommended security best practices, may unintentionally load an undesired and potentially malicious Amazon Machine Image (AMI) from the uncurated public community AMI catalog.",
  "notes": {
    "msalvatore": "This CVE may actually be against hashicorp/packer instead of awscli. Monitor https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/issues/6584 to see if this actually affects awscli. Amazon has addressed this: \"The ability to query for images without specifying an owner is the intended design.\" \"This seems to have been a gap in 3rd party software\" Ignoring awscli package.",
    "redhat": "Closing this bug as NOTABUG and asked MITRE for rejection, since the issue does not seem to be in AWS CLI but in Packer."
