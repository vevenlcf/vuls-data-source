  "candidate": "CVE-2018-3180",
  "description": "Vulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded, JRockit component of Oracle Java SE (subcomponent: JSSE). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 6u201, 7u191, 8u182 and 11; Java SE Embedded: 8u181; JRockit: R28.3.19. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via SSL/TLS to compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded, JRockit. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Java SE, Java SE Embedded, JRockit accessible data as well as unauthorized read access to a subset of Java SE, Java SE Embedded, JRockit accessible data and unauthorized ability to cause a partial denial of service (partial DOS) of Java SE, Java SE Embedded, JRockit. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets (in Java SE 8), that load and run untrusted code (e.g. code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability can also be exploited by using APIs in the specified Component, e.g. through a web service which supplies data to the APIs. CVSS 3.0 Base Score 5.6 (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L).",
  "ubuntu_description": "Felix Dörre discovered that the Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE) implementation in OpenJDK did not ensure that the same endpoint identification algorithm was used during TLS session resumption as during initial session setup. An attacker could use this to expose sensitive information.",
