  "candidate": "CVE-2018-15473",
  "description": "OpenSSH through 7.7 is prone to a user enumeration vulnerability due to not delaying bailout for an invalid authenticating user until after the packet containing the request has been fully parsed, related to auth2-gss.c, auth2-hostbased.c, and auth2-pubkey.c.",
  "notes": {
    "leosilva": "for openss, cosmic is not affected, and so disco too.",
    "mdeslaur": "watch for regressions, see debian ELA-37-3",
    "seth-arnold": "openssh-ssh1 is provided for compatibility with old devices that cannot be upgraded to modern protocols. Thus we may not provide security support for this package if doing so would prevent access to equipment. openssh-ssh1 is a *client-only* package, no server-side facility, so there is no path to leak data"
