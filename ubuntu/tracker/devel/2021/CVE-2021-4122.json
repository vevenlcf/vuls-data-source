  "description": "It was found that a specially crafted LUKS header could trick cryptsetup into disabling encryption during the recovery of the device. An attacker with physical access to the medium, such as a flash disk, could use this flaw to force a user into permanently disabling the encryption layer of that medium.",

    "amurray": "Vulnerability is in the online re-encryption feature which is only",
    "mdeslaur": "per upstream, the backport to 2.2 would be very problematic and it is suggested that the best option is to disable online reencryption",
