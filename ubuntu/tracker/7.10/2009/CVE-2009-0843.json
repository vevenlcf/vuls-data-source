  "candidate": "CVE-2009-0843",
  "description": "The msLoadQuery function in mapserv in MapServer 4.x before 4.10.4 and 5.x before 5.2.2 allows remote attackers to determine the existence of arbitrary files via a full pathname in the queryfile parameter, which triggers different error messages depending on whether this pathname exists.",
