  "candidate": "CVE-2009-0127",
  "description": "** DISPUTED ** M2Crypto does not properly check the return value from the OpenSSL EVP_VerifyFinal, DSA_verify, ECDSA_verify, DSA_do_verify, and ECDSA_do_verify functions, which might allow remote attackers to bypass validation of the certificate chain via a malformed SSL/TLS signature, a similar vulnerability to CVE-2008-5077.  NOTE: a Linux vendor disputes the relevance of this report to the M2Crypto product because \"these functions are not used anywhere in m2crypto.\"",
  "notes": {
    "mdeslaur": "may not be an issue, see redhat bug debian: \"m2crypto provides a direct mapping of the OpenSSL functions, no incorrect call sites are known, if such are found they should be fixed in the respective\" marking this as ignored"
