  "candidate": "CVE-2008-5079",
  "description": "net/atm/svc.c in the ATM subsystem in the Linux kernel 2.6.27.8 and earlier allows local users to cause a denial of service (kernel infinite loop) by making two calls to svc_listen for the same socket, and then reading a /proc/net/atm/*vc file, related to corruption of the vcc table.",
  "ubuntu_description": "Hugo Dias discovered that the ATM subsystem did not correctly manage socket counts.  A local attacker could exploit this to cause a system hang, leading to a denial of service.",
