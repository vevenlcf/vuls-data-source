  "candidate": "CVE-2008-4618",
  "description": "The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (sctp) implementation in the Linux kernel before 2.6.27 does not properly handle a protocol violation in which a parameter has an invalid length, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (panic) via unspecified vectors, related to sctp_sf_violation_paramlen, sctp_sf_abort_violation, sctp_make_abort_violation, and incorrect data types in function calls.",
  "ubuntu_description": "It was discovered that the SCTP stack did not correctly handle bad packet lengths.  A remote user could exploit this by sending specially crafted SCTP traffic which would trigger a crash in the system, leading to a denial of service.  This issue did not affect Ubuntu 8.10.",
