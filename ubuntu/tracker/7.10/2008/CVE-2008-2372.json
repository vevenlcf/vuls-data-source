  "candidate": "CVE-2008-2372",
  "description": "The Linux kernel 2.6.24 and 2.6.25 before 2.6.25.9 allows local users to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via a large number of calls to the get_user_pages function, which lacks a ZERO_PAGE optimization and results in allocation of \"useless newly zeroed pages.\"",
  "ubuntu_description": "It was discovered that the disabling of the ZERO_PAGE optimization could lead to large memory consumption.  A local attacker could exploit this to allocate all available memory, leading to a denial of service.",
  "notes": {
    "kees": "is this even security-relevant? linux-2.6: 89f5b7da2a6bad2e84670422ab8192382a5aeb9f and also: 672ca28e300c17bf8d792a2a7a8631193e580c74 (vmware breakage) this is being fixed via -proposed -20 abi (which will likely be -22 in the end)"
