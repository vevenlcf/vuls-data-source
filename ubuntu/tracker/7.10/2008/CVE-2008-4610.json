  "notes": {
    "mdeslaur": "First issue is the same as CVE-2008-5244, but for mplayer The ogm issue is a ffmpeg problem. Just a crasher.",
    "sbeattie": "according to debian, first issue is actually a crash in libfaad2, though earlier mplayer didn't link against system libfaad2 examining packages, 2:1.0~rc4.dfsg1+svn33713-1 appears to be the first one that links against system libfaad"
