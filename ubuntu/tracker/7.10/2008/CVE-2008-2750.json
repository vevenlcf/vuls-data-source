  "candidate": "CVE-2008-2750",
  "description": "The pppol2tp_recvmsg function in drivers/net/pppol2tp.c in the Linux kernel 2.6 before 2.6.26-rc6 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (kernel heap memory corruption and system crash) and possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted PPPOL2TP packet that results in a large value for a certain length variable.",
  "ubuntu_description": "The PPP over L2TP routines in the kernel did not correctly handle certain messages.  A remote attacker could send a specially crafted packet that could crash the system or execute arbitrary code.",
