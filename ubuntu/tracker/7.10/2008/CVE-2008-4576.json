  "candidate": "CVE-2008-4576",
  "description": "sctp in Linux kernel before 2.6.25.18 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (OOPS) via an INIT-ACK that states the peer does not support AUTH, which causes the sctp_process_init function to clean up active transports and triggers the OOPS when the T1-Init timer expires.",
  "ubuntu_description": "It was discovered that the SCTP stack did not correctly handle INIT-ACK. A remote user could exploit this by sending specially crafted SCTP traffic which would trigger a crash in the system, leading to a denial of service.  This issue did not affect Ubuntu 8.10.",
