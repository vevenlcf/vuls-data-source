  "candidate": "CVE-2008-4210",
  "description": "fs/open.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.22 does not properly strip setuid and setgid bits when there is a write to a file, which allows local users to gain the privileges of a different group, and obtain sensitive information or possibly have unspecified other impact, by creating an executable file in a setgid directory through the (1) truncate or (2) ftruncate function in conjunction with memory-mapped I/O.",
  "ubuntu_description": "David Watson discovered that the kernel did not correctly strip permissions when creating files in setgid directories.  A local user could exploit this to gain additional group privileges.  This issue only affected Ubuntu 6.06.",
