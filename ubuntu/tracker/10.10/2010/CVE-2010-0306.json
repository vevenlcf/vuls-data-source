  "candidate": "CVE-2010-0306",
  "description": "The x86 emulator in KVM 83, when a guest is configured for Symmetric Multiprocessing (SMP), does not use the Current Privilege Level (CPL) and I/O Privilege Level (IOPL) to restrict instruction execution, which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (guest OS crash) or gain privileges on the guest OS by leveraging access to a (1) IO port or (2) MMIO region, and replacing an instruction in between emulator entry and instruction fetch, a related issue to CVE-2010-0298.",
  "ubuntu_description": "It was discovered that KVM did not correctly limit certain privileged IO accesses on x86. Processes in the guest OS with access to IO regions could gain further privileges within the guest OS.",
  "notes": {
    "kees": "access to IO/MMIO requires elevated privileges, which already allows for guest OS disruption. No working upstream solution yet."
