  "candidate": "CVE-2010-0435",
  "description": "The Hypervisor (aka rhev-hypervisor) in Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization (RHEV) 2.2, and KVM 83, when the Intel VT-x extension is enabled, allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and host OS crash) via vectors related to instruction emulation.",
  "ubuntu_description": "Gleb Napatov discovered that KVM did not correctly check certain privileged operations. A local attacker with access to a guest kernel could exploit this to crash the host system, leading to a denial of service.",
  "notes": {
    "kees": "guest can crash host but a fix was included for Lucid anyway?",
    "smb": "Looking at the redhat bugzilla it says: \"If emulator is tricked into emulating mov to/from DR instruction it causes NULL pointer dereference on VMX since kvm_x86_ops-\u003e(set|get)_dr are not initialized.\" Now before v2.6.36-rc1 KVM has no ops-\u003e(set|get)_dr but calls the function directly. So that Oops cannot happen. It was by upstream. Now pulled that change back to Hardy and Karmic. I believe the reference in the backport is pointing to upstream commit 020df0794f5764e742feaa718be88b8f1b4ce04f which was part of 2.6.35-rc1"
