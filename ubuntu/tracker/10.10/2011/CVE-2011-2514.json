  "description": "The Java Network Launching Protocol (JNLP) implementation in IcedTea6 1.9.x before 1.9.9 and before 1.8.9, and IcedTea-Web 1.1.x before 1.1.1 and before 1.0.4, allows remote attackers to trick victims into granting access to local files by modifying the content of the Java Web Start Security Warning dialog box to represent a different filename than the file for which access will be granted.",
  "ubuntu_description": "Omair Majid discovered that an unsigned Web Start application could manipulate the content of the security warning dialog message to show different file names in prompts. This could allow a remote attacker to confuse a user into granting access to a different file than they believe they are granting access to. This issue only affected Ubuntu 11.04.",
