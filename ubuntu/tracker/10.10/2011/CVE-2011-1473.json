  "candidate": "CVE-2011-1473",
  "description": "** DISPUTED ** OpenSSL before 0.9.8l, and 0.9.8m through 1.x, does not properly restrict client-initiated renegotiation within the SSL and TLS protocols, which might make it easier for remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) by performing many renegotiations within a single connection, a different vulnerability than CVE-2011-5094. NOTE: it can also be argued that it is the responsibility of server deployments, not a security library, to prevent or limit renegotiation when it is inappropriate within a specific environment.",
  "notes": {
    "jdstrand": "Protocol issue. Nothing to be done at this time. Marking low because while renegotiation makes the DoS faster, standard DoS methods still apply for SSL servers that need to setup the SSL connection. per Redhat, should not affect httpd/mod_ssl",
    "mdeslaur": "this CVE is specific to openssl, nss is in CVE-2011-5094 we're not going to fix this, since it's disputed"
