  "description": "Use-after-free vulnerability in WebKit before r65958, as used in Google Chrome before 6.0.472.59, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via vectors that trigger use of document APIs such as document.close during parsing, as demonstrated by a Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) file referencing an invalid SVG font, aka rdar problem 8442098.",
  "notes": {
    "jdstrand": "qt4-x11 unmaintained upstream (see README.webkit for details) webkit is a fork of khtml from kdelibs. kdelibs5 is farther from it, while qt4-x11 attempts to unify khtml and webkit. chromium-browser usually has its own CVEs for its own embedded webkit, but adjust it as needed",
