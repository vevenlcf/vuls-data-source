  "candidate": "CVE-2011-0989",
  "description": "The RuntimeHelpers.InitializeArray method in metadata/icall.c in Mono, when Moonlight 2.x before 2.4.1 or 3.x before 3.99.3 is used, does not properly restrict data types, which allows remote attackers to modify internal read-only data structures, and cause a denial of service (plugin crash) or corrupt the internal state of the security manager, via a crafted media file, as demonstrated by modifying a C# struct.",

    "jdstrand": "2.10.5-1 has the fixes in source",
    "mdeslaur": "upstream note: The bug (and fix) is in mono source code but can only be exploited (by untrusted applications) when used by Moonlight. Setting severity to negligible."
