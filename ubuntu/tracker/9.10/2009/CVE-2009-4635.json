  "candidate": "CVE-2009-4635",
  "description": "FFmpeg 0.5 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted MOV container with improperly ordered tags that cause (1) mov.c and (2) utils.c to use inconsistent codec types and identifiers, leading to processing of a video-structure pointer by the mp3 decoder, and a stack-based buffer overflow.",
  "notes": {
    "kees": "stack-protected on Edgy and later, just a DoS",
    "mdeslaur": "This is issue #22 The patch for this issue has not been commited by upstream into the 5.x branch. I could not reproduce the issue with 5.x and the google reproducer. The patch included in usn-931-1 caused a regression, so was removed in usn-931-2."
