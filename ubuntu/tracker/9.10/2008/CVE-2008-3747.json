  "candidate": "CVE-2008-3747",
  "description": "The (1) get_edit_post_link and (2) get_edit_comment_link functions in wp-includes/link-template.php in WordPress before 2.6.1 do not force SSL communication in the intended situations, which might allow remote attackers to gain administrative access by sniffing the network for a cookie.",
  "notes": {
    "jdstrand": "per upstream via stefanlsd, SSL functionality doesn't exist before 2.6.0. However, Debian is trying to backport the SSL functionality, believing that lack of SSL is an extension of this CVE. stefanlsd and upstream feel that this approach is dangerous and messy. It has been marked as Won't Fix in LP, but can be reopened if the Debian patch is viable. Debian patch is included in 2.5.1-6 (broken) and 2.5.1-7"
