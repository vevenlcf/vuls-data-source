{
  "candidate": "CVE-2017-15131",
  "description": "It was found that system umask policy is not being honored when creating XDG user directories, since Xsession sources xdg-user-dirs.sh before setting umask policy. This only affects xdg-user-dirs before 0.15.5 as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux.",
  "notes": {
    "rodrigo-zaiden": "pam_umask is being used to set umask when an interactive session is started, so Ubuntu is not affected by this CVE.",
    "seth-arnold": "This feels like a fundamental misunderstanding of Unix model to assume that every task run on behalf of a user will be started as a child process of bash or sh run as an interactive or login shell. Environments that want a specific umask set for users should use the pam_umask(8) module as part of the login process. Environments that need a specific umask set for compliance reasons should investigate the feasibility of preparing a single-purpose LSM or seccomp jail interface of some sort."
