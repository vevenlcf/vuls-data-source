  "candidate": "CVE-2017-1000083",
  "description": "backend/comics/comics-document.c (aka the comic book backend) in GNOME Evince before 3.24.1 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via a .cbt file that is a TAR archive containing a filename beginning with a \"--\" command-line option substring, as demonstrated by a --checkpoint-action=exec=bash at the beginning of the filename.",
  "ubuntu_description": "Felix Wilhelm discovered that Evince did not safely invoke tar when handling tar comic book (cbt) files. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious comic book format file that, when opened in Evince, executes arbitrary code.",
  "notes": {
    "sbeattie": "upstream evince in git has switched to using libarchive The fix for this issue disables CBT support, as tar offers to many opportunities to invoke commands and CBT is a rarely used comic book format."
