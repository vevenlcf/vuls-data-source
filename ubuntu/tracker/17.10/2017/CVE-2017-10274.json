  "candidate": "CVE-2017-10274",
  "description": "Vulnerability in the Java SE component of Oracle Java SE (subcomponent: Smart Card IO). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 6u161, 7u151, 8u144 and 9. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized creation, deletion or modification access to critical data or all Java SE accessible data as well as unauthorized access to critical data or complete access to all Java SE accessible data. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an administrator). CVSS 3.0 Base Score 6.8 (Confidentiality and Integrity impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N).",
  "ubuntu_description": "It was discovered that the Smart Card IO subsystem in OpenJDK did not properly maintain state. An attacker could use this to specially construct an untrusted Java application or applet to gain access to a smart card, bypassing sandbox restrictions.",
