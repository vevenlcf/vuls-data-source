  "description": "Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in action/AttachFile.py in MoinMoin 1.8.2 and earlier allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via (1) an AttachFile sub-action in the error_msg function or (2) multiple vectors related to package file errors in the upload_form function, different vectors than CVE-2009-0260.",
  "notes": {
    "mdeslaur": "debian says etch is not affected, as the XSS vulns are already fixed. I checked dapper and hardy and they don't seem affected either."
