  "candidate": "CVE-2010-1769",
  "description": "WebKit in Apple iTunes before 9.2 on Windows, and Apple iOS before 4 on the iPhone and iPod touch, accesses out-of-bounds memory during the handling of tables, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (application crash) via a crafted HTML document, a different vulnerability than CVE-2010-1387 and CVE-2010-1763.",
  "notes": {
    "jdstrand": "webkit is a fork of khtml from kdelibs. kdelibs5 is farther from it, while qt4-x11 attempts to unify khtml and webkit.",
    "mdeslaur": "webkitkde is a wrapper around qt4-x11's webkit. this looks like an ipod specific dupe of CVE-2010-1774."
