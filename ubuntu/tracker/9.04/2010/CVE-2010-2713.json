  "description": "The vte_sequence_handler_window_manipulation function in vteseq.c in libvte (aka libvte9) in VTE 0.25.1 and earlier, as used in gnome-terminal, does not properly handle escape sequences, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands or obtain potentially sensitive information via a (1) window title or (2) icon title sequence.
