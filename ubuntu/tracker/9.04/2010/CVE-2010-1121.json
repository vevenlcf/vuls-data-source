  "candidate": "CVE-2010-1121",
  "description": "Mozilla Firefox 3.6.x before 3.6.3 does not properly manage the scopes of DOM nodes that are moved from one document to another, which allows remote attackers to conduct use-after-free attacks and execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors involving improper interaction with garbage collection, as demonstrated by Nils during a Pwn2Own competition at CanSecWest 2010.",
  "notes": {
    "jdstrand": "CVEs in Firefox are tracked in the xulrunner source packages. The mapping of xulrunner sources to firefox is: xulrunner (1.8.0): firefox (1.5) - Ubuntu 6.06 LTS xulrunner (1.8.1): firefox (2.0) - Ubuntu 6.10 - 8.04 LTS xulrunner-1.9: firefox-3.0 xulrunner-1.9.1: firefox-3.5 Ubuntu 6.06 LTS and 10.04 LTS uses the embedded xulrunner and not the system xulrunner-1.9.2, so it is tracked in the firefox source package. thunderbird 2 not affected",
