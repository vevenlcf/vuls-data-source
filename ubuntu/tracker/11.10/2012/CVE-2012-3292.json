  "description": "The GridFTP in Globus Toolkit (GT) before 5.2.2, when certain autoconf macros are defined, does not properly check the return value from the getpwnam_r function, which might allow remote attackers to gain privileges by logging in with a user that does not exist, which causes GridFTP to run as the last user in the password file.",

    "sbeattie": "it affects releases older than 5.2 if threading was enabled note 6.5-1 was when 5.2.0 toolkit was introduced"
