  "candidate": "CVE-2011-4114",
  "description": "The par_mktmpdir function in the PAR::Packer module before 1.012 for Perl creates temporary files in a directory with a predictable name without verifying ownership and permissions of this directory, which allows local users to overwrite files when another user extracts a PAR packed program. NOTE: a similar vulnerability was reported for PAR, but this has been assigned a different CVE identifier.",

    "sbeattie": "libpar-perl issued the fix for this issue annotated with CVE-2011-4114; however, it subsequently got split out into a separate cve, CVE-2011-5060."
