  "candidate": "CVE-2019-12929",
  "description": "** DISPUTED ** The QMP guest_exec command in QEMU 4.0.0 and earlier is prone to OS command injection, which allows the attacker to achieve code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure by sending a crafted QMP command to the listening server. Note: This has been disputed as a non-issue since QEMU's -qmp interface is meant to be used by trusted users. If one is able to access this interface via a tcp socket open to the internet, then it is an insecure configuration issue.",

    "mdeslaur": "marking as ignored as this is working as designed and should not be used by non-trusted users"
