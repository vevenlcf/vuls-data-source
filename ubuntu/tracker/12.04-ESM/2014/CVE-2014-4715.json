  "candidate": "CVE-2014-4715",
  "description": "Yann Collet LZ4 before r119, when used on certain 32-bit platforms that allocate memory beyond 0x80000000, does not properly detect integer overflows, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted Literal Run, a different vulnerability than CVE-2014-4611.",
  "ubuntu_description": "It was discovered that LZ4 incorrectly handled integers. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or other unspecified impact.",
  "notes": {
    "mdeslaur": "code in grub2 is different, no indication it is vulnerable to the same issue. Marking as not-affected."
