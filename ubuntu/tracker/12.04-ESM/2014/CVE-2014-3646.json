  "description": "arch/x86/kvm/vmx.c in the KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel through 3.17.2 does not have an exit handler for the INVVPID instruction, which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (guest OS crash) via a crafted application. A local unprivileged guest user could use this flaw to crash the guest.",
