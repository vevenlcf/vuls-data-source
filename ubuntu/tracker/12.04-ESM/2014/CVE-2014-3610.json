  "candidate": "CVE-2014-3610",
  "description": "The WRMSR processing functionality in the KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel through 3.17.2 does not properly handle the writing of a non-canonical address to a model-specific register, which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (host OS crash) by leveraging guest OS privileges, related to the wrmsr_interception function in arch/x86/kvm/svm.c and the handle_wrmsr function in arch/x86/kvm/vmx.c. A privileged guest user can use this flaw to crash the host. Enabling CONFIG_PARAVIRT when building the kernel mitigates this issue because wrmsrl() ends up invoking safe msr write variant.",
  "ubuntu_description": "Lars Bull and Nadav Amit reported a flaw in how KVM (the Kernel Virtual Machine) handles noncanonical writes to certain MSR registers. A privileged guest user can exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (kernel panic) on the host.",
