  "candidate": "CVE-2017-17458",
  "description": "In Mercurial before 4.4.1, it is possible that a specially malformed repository can cause Git subrepositories to run arbitrary code in the form of a .git/hooks/post-update script checked into the repository. Typical use of Mercurial prevents construction of such repositories, but they can be created programmatically.",
  "ubuntu_description": "It was discovered that Mercurial incorrectly handled malformed repositories. An attacker could possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary code.",
