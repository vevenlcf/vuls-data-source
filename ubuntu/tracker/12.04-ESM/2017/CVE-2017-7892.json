  "candidate": "CVE-2017-7892",
  "description": "Sandstorm Cap'n Proto before 0.5.3.1 allows remote crashes related to a compiler optimization. A remote attacker can trigger a segfault in a 32-bit libcapnp application because Cap'n Proto relies on pointer arithmetic calculations that overflow. An example compiler with optimization that elides a bounds check in such calculations is Apple LLVM version 8.1.0 (clang-802.0.41). The attack vector is a crafted far pointer within a message.",
  "ubuntu_description": "Kenton Varda discovered that the Cap'n Proto utility has a buffer overflow vulnerability. An attacker could use this vulnerability to cause a crash or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
  "notes": {
    "ratliff": "Advisory: \"Some bounds checks are elided by Apple's compiler and possibly others, leading to a possible attack especially in 32-bit builds.\" Setting status to needs-triage to investigate whether it impacts Ubuntu"
