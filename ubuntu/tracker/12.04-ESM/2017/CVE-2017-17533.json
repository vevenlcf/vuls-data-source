  "description": "** DISPUTED ** default.tcl in Tkabber 1.1 does not validate strings before launching the program specified by the BROWSER environment variable, which might allow remote attackers to conduct argument-injection attacks via a crafted URL. NOTE: a third party has indicated that the attack cannot occur because of the argument-parsing behavior of the Tcl exec function.",
