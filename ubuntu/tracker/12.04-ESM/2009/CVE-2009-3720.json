  "candidate": "CVE-2009-3720",
  "description": "The updatePosition function in lib/xmltok_impl.c in libexpat in Expat 2.0.1, as used in Python, PyXML, w3c-libwww, and other software, allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via an XML document with crafted UTF-8 sequences that trigger a buffer over-read, a different vulnerability than CVE-2009-2625.",
  "notes": {
    "ebarretto": "this is not an issue for vnc4, for more information see: https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=560949",
    "jdstrand": "both this and CVE-2009-2625 refer to the same expat bug: #1990430. See http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2009/09/06/1 This CVE was later assigned to the same issue, since CVE-2009-2625 was worded as a Java vulnerability. Our USN references CVE-2009-2625 and this CVE will be ignored (for expat). jdstrand provided updates in supported releases for expat, xmlrpc-c, cmake, python-xml, python2.4, and python2.5"
