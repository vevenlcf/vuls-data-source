  "candidate": "CVE-2018-19518",
  "description": "University of Washington IMAP Toolkit 2007f on UNIX, as used in imap_open() in PHP and other products, launches an rsh command (by means of the imap_rimap function in c-client/imap4r1.c and the tcp_aopen function in osdep/unix/tcp_unix.c) without preventing argument injection, which might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands if the IMAP server name is untrusted input (e.g., entered by a user of a web application) and if rsh has been replaced by a program with different argument semantics. For example, if rsh is a link to ssh (as seen on Debian and Ubuntu systems), then the attack can use an IMAP server name containing a \"-oProxyCommand\" argument.",
  "ubuntu_description": "It was discovered that UW IMAP incorrectly handled inputs. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary OS commands.",
  "notes": {
    "mdeslaur": "php5 in precise and trusty doesn't build imap, it is in a separate php-imap source package.",
    "msalvatore": "uw-imap has been defunct since 2008."
