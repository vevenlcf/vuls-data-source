  "candidate": "CVE-2018-20340",
  "description": "Yubico libu2f-host 1.1.6 contains unchecked buffers in devs.c, which could enable a malicious token to exploit a buffer overflow. An attacker could use this to attempt to execute malicious code using a crafted USB device masquerading as a security token on a computer where the affected library is currently in use. It is not possible to perform this attack with a genuine YubiKey.",

    "sbeattie": "requires libpam-u2f setup or other yubikey based software applications. Browser U2F implmentations are NOT affected."
