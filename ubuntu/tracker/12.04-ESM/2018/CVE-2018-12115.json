{
  "candidate": "CVE-2018-12115",
  "description": "In all versions of Node.js prior to 6.14.4, 8.11.4 and 10.9.0 when used with UCS-2 encoding (recognized by Node.js under the names `'ucs2'`, `'ucs-2'`, `'utf16le'` and `'utf-16le'`), `Buffer#write()` can be abused to write outside of the bounds of a single `Buffer`. Writes that start from the second-to-last position of a buffer cause a miscalculation of the maximum length of the input bytes to be written.",
  "ubuntu_description": "Nikita Skovoroda  discovered that Node.js mishandled certain input, leading to an out of bounds write. An attacker could use this vulnerability to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
