  "candidate": "CVE-2018-2602",
  "description": "Vulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded component of Oracle Java SE (subcomponent: I18n). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 6u171, 7u161, 8u152 and 9.0.1; Java SE Embedded: 8u151. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with logon to the infrastructure where Java SE, Java SE Embedded executes to compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Java SE, Java SE Embedded accessible data as well as unauthorized read access to a subset of Java SE, Java SE Embedded accessible data and unauthorized ability to cause a partial denial of service (partial DOS) of Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an administrator). CVSS 3.0 Base Score 4.5 (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L).",
