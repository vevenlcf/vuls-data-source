Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE, JRockit. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Java SE, JRockit accessible data as well as unauthorized read access to a subset of Java SE, JRockit accessible data. Note: This vulnerability can only be exploited by supplying data to APIs in the specified Component without using Untrusted Java Web Start applications or Untrusted Java applets, such as through a web service. CVSS 3.0 Base Score 4.2 (Confidentiality and Integrity impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N).",
  "ubuntu_description": "Moritz Bechler discovered that the RMI component of OpenJDK enabled HTTP transport for RMI servers by default. A remote attacker could use this to gain access to restricted services.",
  "notes": {
    "sbeattie": "Oracle note on this issue: Server side HTTP-tunneled RMI connections have been disabled by default in this release. This behavior can be reverted by setting the runtime property sun.rmi.server.disableIncomingHttp property to false.  Note, this should not be confused with the sun.rmi.server.disableHttp property, which disables HTTP-tunneling on the client side and is false by default."
