  "candidate": "CVE-2020-27781",
  "description": "User credentials can be manipulated and stolen by Native CephFS consumers of OpenStack Manila, resulting in potential privilege escalation. An Open Stack Manila user can request access to a share to an arbitrary cephx user, including existing users. The access key is retrieved via the interface drivers. Then, all users of the requesting OpenStack project can view the access key. This enables the attacker to target any resource that the user has access to. This can be done to even \"admin\" users, compromising the ceph administrator. This flaw affects Ceph versions prior to 14.2.16, 15.x prior to 15.2.8, and 16.x prior to 16.2.0.",
  "ubuntu_description": "Goutham Pacha Ravi, Jahson Babel, and John Garbutt discovered that user credentials in Ceph could be manipulated in certain environments. An attacker could use this to gain unintended access to resources.",
