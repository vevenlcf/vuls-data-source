  "candidate": "CVE-2020-29510",
  "description": "The encoding/xml package in Go versions 1.15 and earlier does not correctly preserve the semantics of directives during tokenization round-trips, which allows an attacker to craft inputs that behave in conflicting ways during different stages of processing in affected downstream applications.",
  "notes": {
    "mdeslaur": "Packages built using golang need to be rebuilt once the vulnerability has been fixed. This CVE entry does not list packages that need rebuilding outside of the main repository or the Ubuntu variants with PPA overlays.  as of 2021-08-10, there likely won't be a fix for this issue by the upstream go developers"
