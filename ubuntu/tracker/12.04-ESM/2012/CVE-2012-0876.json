  "candidate": "CVE-2012-0876",
  "description": "The XML parser (xmlparse.c) in expat before 2.1.0 computes hash values without restricting the ability to trigger hash collisions predictably, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via an XML file with many identifiers with the same value.",
  "notes": {
    "ebarretto": "tla uses system expat as of 1.3.5+dfsg-15",
    "jdstrand": "RedHat issued https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2012-1250.html for python as a result of the added XML_SetHashSalt symbol",
    "rodrigo-zaiden": "the vulnerable code was added in expat version 1.95.7, with commit https://github.com/libexpat/libexpat/commit/8650b04b libxmltok seems to use code based on expat version 1.2 and does not add this commit, so, it's not affected."
