  "candidate": "CVE-2013-4132",
  "description": "KDE-Workspace 4.10.5 and earlier does not properly handle the return value of the glibc 2.17 crypt and pw_encrypt functions, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and crash) via (1) an invalid salt or a (2) DES or (3) MD5 encrypted password, when FIPS-140 is enable, to KDM or an (4) invalid password to KCheckPass.",
  "notes": {
    "mdeslaur": "This is only an issue on glibc 2.17+, so precise and quantal aren't affected. Also, our kde-workspace packages are compiled with pam support, so they shouldn't be vulnerable.",
    "seth-arnold": "NULL return from crypt() if the salt isn't sane"
