  "candidate": "CVE-2013-0335",
  "description": "OpenStack Compute (Nova) Grizzly, Folsom (2012.2), and Essex (2012.1) allows remote authenticated users to gain access to a VM in opportunistic circumstances by using the VNC token for a deleted VM that was bound to the same VNC port.",
  "notes": {
    "jdstrand": "on 11.10, VNC consoles are only available via the web interface, but the web interface (horizon) is not functional since it depends on keystone and the keystone in 11.10 is a pre-release version and unusable with other components like horizon and nova."
