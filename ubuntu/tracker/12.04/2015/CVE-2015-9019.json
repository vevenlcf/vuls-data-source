  "candidate": "CVE-2015-9019",
  "description": "In libxslt 1.1.29 and earlier, the EXSLT math.random function was not initialized with a random seed during startup, which could cause usage of this function to produce predictable outputs.",
  "notes": {
    "ccdm94": "there is no upstream patch provided for this issue. The random function in libxslt does not guarantee it will adhere to all cryptographic requirements, and applications using libxslt are expected to be the ones performing the seeding of the system's PRNG in order to achieve proper randomness. For this reason, status for all releases will be set to ignored.",
    "mdeslaur": "as of 2022-08-05, no indication that upstream will fix this",
    "sbeattie": "upstream fixed this for xsltproc, but libxslt remains unfixed not clear what the security impact of this is"
