  "candidate": "CVE-2015-2331",
  "description": "Integer overflow in the _zip_cdir_new function in zip_dirent.c in libzip 0.11.2 and earlier, as used in the ZIP extension in PHP before 5.4.39, 5.5.x before 5.5.23, and 5.6.x before 5.6.7 and other products, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a ZIP archive that contains many entries, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.",

    "mdeslaur": "libzip in trusty and earlier doesn't support ZIP64, so doesn't look vulnerable. php5 in utopic and earlier doesn't support ZIP64 either.",
