  "candidate": "CVE-2012-5519",
  "description": "CUPS 1.4.4, when running in certain Linux distributions such as Debian GNU/Linux, stores the web interface administrator key in /var/run/cups/certs/0 using certain permissions, which allows local users in the lpadmin group to read or write arbitrary files as root by leveraging the web interface.",
  "notes": {
    "mdeslaur": "On Ubuntu, file disclosure and corruption is limited by the AppArmor profile, which limits exposure. It still can access some important files though, such as /etc/shadow.  Upstream patch moves dangerous configuration options to a second config file which is not web-editable. Although this is a good long-term solution, the changes are too intrusive for a security update. The most sensible thing to do at this time is to completely disable modifying the cupsd.conf file via the web interface."
