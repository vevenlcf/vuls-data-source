  "description": "Apache Struts 2 2.3.20 through 2.3.28.1 mishandles token validation, which allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks via unspecified vectors.",
  "notes": {
    "seth-arnold": "It's claimed \"Struts 2.3.20 - Struts Struts 2.3.28.1\" but I see no positive statement that 2.3.19 and earlier weren't affected or perhaps may have missed CSRF protection entirely or just outside of support lifetimes or whatever. So I'm leaving this 'needs-triage'."
