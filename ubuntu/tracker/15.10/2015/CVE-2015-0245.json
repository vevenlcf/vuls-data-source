  "candidate": "CVE-2015-0245",
  "description": "D-Bus 1.4.x through 1.6.x before 1.6.30, 1.8.x before 1.8.16, and 1.9.x before 1.9.10 does not validate the source of ActivationFailure signals, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (activation failure error returned) by leveraging a race condition involving sending an ActivationFailure signal before systemd responds.",
  "notes": {
    "seth-arnold": "The policy change is recommended for stable use, though the code-based changes were made for platforms where uid==0 may not be omnipotent -- we should probably use both in our packages, or at least both for the versions with distro-patched AppArmor support."
