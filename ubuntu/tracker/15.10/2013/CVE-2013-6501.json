  "candidate": "CVE-2013-6501",
  "description": "The default soap.wsdl_cache_dir setting in (1) php.ini-production and (2) php.ini-development in PHP through 5.6.7 specifies the /tmp directory, which makes it easier for local users to conduct WSDL injection attacks by creating a file under /tmp with a predictable filename that is used by the get_sdl function in ext/soap/php_sdl.c.",
  "notes": {
    "mdeslaur": "we will not be fixing this issue. In environments where this issue is problematic, we recommend setting soap.wsdl_cache_dir to another location"
