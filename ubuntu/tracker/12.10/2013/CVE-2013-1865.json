  "candidate": "CVE-2013-1865",
  "description": "OpenStack Keystone Folsom (2012.2) does not properly perform revocation checks for Keystone PKI tokens when done through a server, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions via a revoked PKI token.",
  "notes": {
    "jdstrand": "Keystone on 11.10 is a pre-release version and unusable with other components such as nova and horizon requires non-standard configuration (ie, using PKI tokens instead of UUID) per upstream, grizzly is not affected Essex does not support PKI tokens and is therefore not affected"
