  "candidate": "CVE-2013-1654",
  "description": "Puppet 2.7.x before 2.7.21 and 3.1.x before 3.1.1, and Puppet Enterprise 2.7.x before 2.7.2, does not properly negotiate the SSL protocol between client and master, which allows remote attackers to conduct SSLv2 downgrade attacks against SSLv3 sessions via unspecified vectors.",
  "notes": {
    "mdeslaur": "Upstream no longer supports 0.25.x as found in lucid. The code is substantially different, rendering a backport of this security update difficult. Since puppet in Lucid is almost end-of-life, we aren't planning on backporting the security fix to it. For Lucid users, we recommend using puppet 2.7.1-1ubuntu3.8~ubuntu10.04.1 currently in lucid-backports."
