  "candidate": "CVE-2019-2053",
  "description": "In wnm_parse_neighbor_report_elem of wnm_sta.c, there is a possible out-of-bounds read due to missing bounds check. This could lead to local information disclosure with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation. Product: Android Versions: Android-7.0 Android-7.1.1 Android-7.1.2 Android-8.0 Android-8.1 Android-9 Android ID: A-122074159",
  "notes": {
    "mdeslaur": "per upstream: The actual read bytes would be stored locally, but they were not used for anything, so other than reading beyond the end of an allocated heap memory buffer, this did not result in any behavior difference or exposure of the bytes."
