  "candidate": "CVE-2019-9515",
  "description": "Some HTTP/2 implementations are vulnerable to a settings flood, potentially leading to a denial of service. The attacker sends a stream of SETTINGS frames to the peer. Since the RFC requires that the peer reply with one acknowledgement per SETTINGS frame, an empty SETTINGS frame is almost equivalent in behavior to a ping. Depending on how efficiently this data is queued, this can consume excess CPU, memory, or both.",
  "ubuntu_description": "It was discovered that Netty incorrectly implements HTTP/2. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service.",
