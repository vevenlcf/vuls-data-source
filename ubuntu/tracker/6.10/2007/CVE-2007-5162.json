  "candidate": "CVE-2007-5162",
  "description": "The connect method in lib/net/http.rb in the (1) Net::HTTP and (2) Net::HTTPS libraries in Ruby 1.8.5 and 1.8.6 does not verify that the commonName (CN) field in a server certificate matches the domain name in an HTTPS request, which makes it easier for remote attackers to intercept SSL transmissions via a man-in-the-middle attack or spoofed web site.",
