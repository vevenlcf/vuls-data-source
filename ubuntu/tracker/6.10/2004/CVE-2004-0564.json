  "candidate": "CVE-2004-0564",
  "description": "Roaring Penguin pppoe (rp-ppoe), if installed or configured to run setuid root contrary to its design, allows local users to overwrite arbitrary files.  NOTE: the developer has publicly disputed the claim that this is a vulnerability because pppoe \"is NOT designed to run setuid-root.\" Therefore this identifier applies *only* to those configurations and installations under which pppoe is run setuid root despite the developer's warnings.",
