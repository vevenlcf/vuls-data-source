NOTE: this description is based on Debian advisory DSA 979, which is based on changes that were made after other vulnerabilities such as CVE-2006-0301 and CVE-2005-3624 through CVE-2005-3628 were fixed.  Some of these newer fixes appear to be security-relevant, although it is not clear if they fix specific issues or are defensive in nature.",
