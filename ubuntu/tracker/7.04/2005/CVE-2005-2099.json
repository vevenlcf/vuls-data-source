  "candidate": "CVE-2005-2099",
  "description": "The Linux kernel before 2.6.12.5 does not properly destroy a keyring that is not instantiated properly, which allows local users or remote attackers to cause a denial of service (kernel oops) via a keyring with a payload that is not empty, which causes the creation to fail, leading to a null dereference in the keyring destructor.",
