  "candidate": "CVE-2007-5135",
  "description": "Off-by-one error in the SSL_get_shared_ciphers function in OpenSSL 0.9.7 up to 0.9.7l, and 0.9.8 up to 0.9.8f, might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted packet that triggers a one-byte buffer underflow.  NOTE: this issue was introduced as a result of a fix for CVE-2006-3738.  As of 20071012, it is unknown whether code execution is possible.",
  "ubuntu_description": "Moritz Jodeit discovered that OpenSSL's SSL_get_shared_ciphers function did not correctly check the size of the buffer it was writing to. A remote attacker could exploit this to write one NULL byte past the end of an application's cipher list buffer, possibly leading to arbitrary code execution or a denial of service.",
