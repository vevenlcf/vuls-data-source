  "candidate": "CVE-2007-5498",
  "description": "The Xen hypervisor block backend driver for Linux kernel 2.6.18, when running on a 64-bit host with a 32-bit paravirtualized guest, allows local privileged users in the guest OS to cause a denial of service (host OS crash) via a request that specifies a large number of blocks.",
  "ubuntu_description": "It was discovered that the Xen hypervisor block driver did not correctly validate requests.  A user with root privileges in a guest OS could make a malicious IO request with a large number of blocks that would crash the host OS, leading to a denial of service.  This only affected Ubuntu 7.10.",
