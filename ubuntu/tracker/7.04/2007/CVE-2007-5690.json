  "description": "** DISPUTED **  Buffer overflow in sethdlc.c in the Asterisk Zaptel 1.4.5.1 might allow local users to gain privileges via a long device name (interface name) in the ifr_name field.  NOTE: the vendor disputes this issue, stating that the application requires root access, so privilege boundaries are not crossed.",
  "notes": {
    "fujitsu": "Not a security vulnerability, as the attacker would need to run the code as root, so there are no privileges to gain.",
