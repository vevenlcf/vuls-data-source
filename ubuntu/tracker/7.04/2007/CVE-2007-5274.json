  "candidate": "CVE-2007-5274",
  "description": "Sun Java Runtime Environment (JRE) in JDK and JRE 6 Update 2 and earlier, JDK and JRE 5.0 Update 12 and earlier, SDK and JRE 1.4.2_15 and earlier, and SDK and JRE 1.3.1_20 and earlier, when Firefox or Opera is used, allows remote attackers to violate the security model for JavaScript outbound connections via a multi-pin DNS rebinding attack dependent on the LiveConnect API, in which JavaScript download relies on DNS resolution by the browser, but JavaScript socket operations rely on separate DNS resolution by a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), a different issue than CVE-2007-5273.  NOTE: this is similar to CVE-2007-5232.",
