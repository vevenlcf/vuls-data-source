  "candidate": "CVE-2007-3996",
  "description": "Multiple integer overflows in libgd in PHP before 5.2.4 allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a large (1) srcW or (2) srcH value to the (a) gdImageCopyResized function, or a large (3) sy (height) or (4) sx (width) value to the (b) gdImageCreate or the (c) gdImageCreateTrueColor function.",
  "notes": {
    "jdstrand": "note this is gdImageCreate and gdImageCreateTrueColor dapper-gutsy libgd2 are affected to varying degrees php5-gd segfaults on feisty and gutsy before patching libgd2, and dapper-gutsy segfault after (this is because feisty-gutsy had a partial fix already in libgd2).  php5-gd is not handling the error condition when libgd2 fails properly.  Verified that 5.2.4 works with patched libgd2."
