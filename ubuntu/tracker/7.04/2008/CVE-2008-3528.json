  "candidate": "CVE-2008-3528",
  "description": "The error-reporting functionality in (1) fs/ext2/dir.c, (2) fs/ext3/dir.c, and possibly (3) fs/ext4/dir.c in the Linux kernel 2.6.26.5 does not limit the number of printk console messages that report directory corruption, which allows physically proximate attackers to cause a denial of service (temporary system hang) by mounting a filesystem that has corrupted dir-\u003ei_size and dir-\u003ei_blocks values and performing (a) read or (b) write operations.  NOTE: there are limited scenarios in which this crosses privilege boundaries.",
