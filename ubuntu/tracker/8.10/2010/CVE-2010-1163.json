  "candidate": "CVE-2010-1163",
  "description": "The command matching functionality in sudo 1.6.8 through 1.7.2p5 does not properly handle when a file in the current working directory has the same name as a pseudo-command in the sudoers file and the PATH contains an entry for \".\", which allows local users to execute arbitrary commands via a Trojan horse executable, as demonstrated using sudoedit, a different vulnerability than CVE-2010-0426.",
  "notes": {
    "jdstrand": "in Ubuntu 9.04 and earlier, sudo is compiled with secure_path, so a user must use sudoedit in sudoers and recompile sudo to not use secure_path. On Karmic, secure_path is configurable via suoders (but still set at compile-time). Ubuntu does not use 'ignore_dot' by default."
