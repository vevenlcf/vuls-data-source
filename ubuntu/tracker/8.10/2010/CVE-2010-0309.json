  "candidate": "CVE-2010-0309",
  "description": "The pit_ioport_read function in the Programmable Interval Timer (PIT) emulation in i8254.c in KVM 83 does not properly use the pit_state data structure, which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (host OS crash or hang) by attempting to read the /dev/port file.",
  "ubuntu_description": "Marcelo Tosatti discovered that the Linux kernel's hardware virtualization did not correctly handle reading the /dev/port special device. A local attacker in a guest operating system could issue a specific read that would cause the host system to crash, leading to a denial of service.",
