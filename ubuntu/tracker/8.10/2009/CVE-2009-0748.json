  "description": "The ext4_fill_super function in fs/ext4/super.c in the Linux kernel 2.6.27 before 2.6.27.19 and 2.6.28 before 2.6.28.7 does not validate the superblock configuration, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and OOPS) by attempting to mount a crafted ext4 filesystem.",
  "ubuntu_description": "The ext4 filesystem did not correctly validate certain superblock fields.  A local attacker could mount a malicious ext4 filesystem, causing a system crash, leading to a denial of service.",
