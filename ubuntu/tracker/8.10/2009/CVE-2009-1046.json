  "candidate": "CVE-2009-1046",
  "description": "The console selection feature in the Linux kernel 2.6.28 before 2.6.28.4, 2.6.25, and possibly earlier versions, when the UTF-8 console is used, allows physically proximate attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) by selecting a small number of 3-byte UTF-8 characters, which triggers an \"off-by-two memory error.\" NOTE: it is not clear whether this issue crosses privilege boundaries.",
  "ubuntu_description": "The virtual consoles did not correctly handle certain UTF-8 sequences. A local attacker on the physical console could exploit this to cause a system crash, leading to a denial of service.",
