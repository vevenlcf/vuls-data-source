  "description": "Stack consumption vulnerability in the do_page_fault function in arch/x86/mm/fault.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.28.5 allows local users to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly gain privileges via unspecified vectors that trigger page faults on a machine that has a registered Kprobes probe.",
  "ubuntu_description": "The page fault handler could consume stack memory.  A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system or gain root privileges with a Kprobe registered.",
