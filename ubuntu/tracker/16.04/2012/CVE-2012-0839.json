  "candidate": "CVE-2012-0839",
  "description": "OCaml 3.12.1 and earlier computes hash values without restricting the ability to trigger hash collisions predictably, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via crafted input to an application that maintains a hash table.",
  "notes": {
    "mdeslaur": "New randomization turned off by default and must be specifically turned on by application. See upstream bug report. Downgrading severity to low, since upstream won't change default behaviour."
