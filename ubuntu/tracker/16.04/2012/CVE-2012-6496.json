  "candidate": "CVE-2012-6496",
  "description": "SQL injection vulnerability in the Active Record component in Ruby on Rails before 3.0.18, 3.1.x before 3.1.9, and 3.2.x before 3.2.10 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via a crafted request that leverages incorrect behavior of dynamic finders in applications that can use unexpected data types in certain find_by_ method calls.",
  "notes": {
    "mdeslaur": "in Oneiric+, rails package is just for transition",
    "seth-arnold": "The authlogic gem was frequently cited as the problem in early reports, but the problem is with core Active Record. authlogic was just one vector known to allow exploiting the problem. CVE-2012-5664 was rejected as a result of the confusion."
