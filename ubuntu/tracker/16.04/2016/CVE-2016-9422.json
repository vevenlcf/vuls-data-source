  "description": "An issue was discovered in the Tatsuya Kinoshita w3m fork before 0.5.3-31. The feed_table_tag function in w3m doesn't properly validate the value of table span, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (stack and/or heap buffer overflow) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted HTML page.",
