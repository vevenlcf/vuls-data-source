  "candidate": "CVE-2016-5399",
  "description": "The bzread function in ext/bz2/bz2.c in PHP before 5.5.38, 5.6.x before 5.6.24, and 7.x before 7.0.9 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds write) or execute arbitrary code via a crafted bz2 archive.",
  "notes": {
    "seth-arnold": "PHP position seems to suggest they'll fix bzread() to ensure it conforms to the documented behaviour but they won't take any steps to 'safe' an improper use of API by applications. Since the API was apparently not honoured before I don't know how an application could be expected to be correct."
