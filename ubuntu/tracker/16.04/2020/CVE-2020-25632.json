  "candidate": "CVE-2020-25632",
  "description": "A flaw was found in grub2 in versions prior to 2.06. The rmmod implementation allows the unloading of a module used as a dependency without checking if any other dependent module is still loaded leading to a use-after-free scenario. This could allow arbitrary code to be executed or a bypass of Secure Boot protections. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.",
  "ubuntu_description": "Chris Coulson discovered that the rmmod command in GRUB 2 contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to execute arbitrary code and bypass UEFI Secure Boot restrictions.",
