  "candidate": "CVE-2022-32744",
  "description": "A flaw was found in Samba. The KDC accepts kpasswd requests encrypted with any key known to it. By encrypting forged kpasswd requests with its own key, a user can change other users' passwords, enabling full domain takeover.",
  "notes": {
    "mdeslaur": "patches for this issue in the bug for CVE-2022-2031 Fixing this in Ubuntu 18.04 LTS would require substantial code backports. We will not be fixing this issue in Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. In environments where this is of concern, we recommend updating to a more recent Ubuntu version, or disabling kpasswd if this is not passible."
