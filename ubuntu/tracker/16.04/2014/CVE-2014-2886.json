{
  "candidate": "CVE-2014-2886",
  "description": "GKSu 2.0.2, when sudo-mode is not enabled, uses \" (double quote) characters in a gksu-run-helper argument, which allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands in certain situations involving an untrusted substring within this argument, as demonstrated by an untrusted filename encountered during installation of a VirtualBox extension pack.",
  "notes": {
    "mdeslaur": "in Ubuntu, sudo-mode is the default, and the root account has no password. On top of that, the fault actually lies in VirtualBox that is not properly escaping the filename before calling gksu."
