  "candidate": "CVE-2014-4607",
  "description": "Integer overflow in the LZO algorithm variant in Oberhumer liblzo2 and lzo-2 before 2.07 on 32-bit platforms might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted Literal Run.",
  "notes": {
    "amurray": "grub2 has a vendored copy of minilzo which is part of lzo2 so likely any vulnerabilities that affect lzo2 may also affect minilzo in grub2 and hence grub2-signed",
    "mdeslaur": "grub2 since bug 1911440 now pulls in the system lzo2 when building, so focal+ is fixed grub2-signed on bionic now ships the grub binary built on a later release, so it is not vulnerable to this CVE"
