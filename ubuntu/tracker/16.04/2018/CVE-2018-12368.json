This also allows a WebExtension with the limited downloads.open permission to execute arbitrary code without user interaction on Windows 10 systems. *Note: this issue only affects Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird \u003c 60, Thunderbird \u003c 52.9, Firefox ESR \u003c 60.1, Firefox ESR \u003c 52.9, and Firefox \u003c 61.",
