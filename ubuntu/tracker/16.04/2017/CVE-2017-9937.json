  "notes": {
    "mdeslaur": "reported in libtiff, but issue lies in jbigkit as of 2018-03-22, no fix available  this is a DoS only and is caused by the fact that jbigkit handles failed memory allocations with abort(). (See checked_malloc()). Fixing this properly would likely require changing the library ABI."
