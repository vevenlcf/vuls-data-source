  "candidate": "CVE-2017-10699",
  "description": "avcodec 2.2.x, as used in VideoLAN VLC media player 2.2.7-x before 2017-06-29, allows out-of-bounds heap memory write due to calling memcpy() with a wrong size, leading to a denial of service (application crash) or possibly code execution.",
  "ubuntu_description": "It was discovered that VLC mishandled certain crafted media files. An attacker could use this vulnerability to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
  "notes": {
    "ratliff": "notes from the upstream: \"The avcodec library does not gives bogus video sizes on 3.0, so the issue only exists on the 2.2.x branch. Fixes have been pushed on the 2.2.x branch and guards added as well on both versions.\""
