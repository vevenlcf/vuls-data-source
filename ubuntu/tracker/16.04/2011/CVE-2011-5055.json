  "description": "MaraDNS 1.3.07.12 and 1.4.08 computes hash values for DNS data without properly restricting the ability to trigger hash collisions predictably, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) by sending many crafted queries with the Recursion Desired (RD) bit set.  NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2012-0024.",
