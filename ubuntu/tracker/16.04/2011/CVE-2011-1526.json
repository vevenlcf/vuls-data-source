  "candidate": "CVE-2011-1526",
  "description": "ftpd.c in the GSS-API FTP daemon in MIT Kerberos Version 5 Applications (aka krb5-appl) 1.0.1 and earlier does not check the krb5_setegid return value, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended group access restrictions, and create, overwrite, delete, or read files, via standard FTP commands, related to missing autoconf tests in a configure script.",
  "notes": {
    "sbeattie": "krb5-appl was split out from the krb5 package between hardy and lucid by upstream; the CVE covers two issues: * the configure test for setegid() wasn't included when krb5-appl was split out and so setegid is defined to always return an error, which thus doesn't affect hardy * the code never checks the return value of setegid, which is a problem when setegid always fails, but less so when the setegid() is a real call, though still a real issue. hardy is affected by this, but less so than the split out krb5-appl packages. Therefore I'm marking this priority low for hardy/krb5"
