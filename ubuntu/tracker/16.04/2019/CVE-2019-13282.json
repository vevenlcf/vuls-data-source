  "candidate": "CVE-2019-13282",
  "description": "In Xpdf 4.01.01, a heap-based buffer over-read could be triggered in SampledFunction::transform in Function.cc when using a large index for samples. It can, for example, be triggered by sending a crafted PDF document to the pdftotext tool. It allows an attacker to use a crafted pdf file to cause Denial of Service or an information leak, or possibly have unspecified other impact.",
