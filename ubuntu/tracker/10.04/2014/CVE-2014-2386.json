  "description": "Multiple off-by-one errors in Icinga, possibly 1.10.2 and earlier, allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via unspecified vectors to the (1) display_nav_table, (2) print_export_link, (3) page_num_selector, or (4) page_limit_selector function in cgi/cgiutils.c or (5) status_page_num_selector function in cgi/status.c, which triggers a stack-based buffer overflow.",
