  "candidate": "CVE-2009-3569",
  "description": "Stack-based buffer overflow in OpenOffice.org (OOo) allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors, as demonstrated by a certain module in VulnDisco Pack Professional 8.8, aka \"Client-side stack overflow exploit.\" NOTE: as of 20091005, this disclosure has no actionable information. However, because the VulnDisco Pack author is a reliable researcher, the issue is being assigned a CVE identifier for tracking purposes.",
  "notes": {
    "jdstrand": "not enough information to do anything. Defer until more information becomes available still no information. Due to stack overflow, marking as protected (just a crasher) and ignoring. Can reopen once more info is available",
    "mdeslaur": "still no info as of 2010-11-11, also probably mitigated by stack protector, downgrading to low"
