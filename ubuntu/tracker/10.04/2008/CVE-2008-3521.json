{
  "candidate": "CVE-2008-3521",
  "description": "Race condition in the jas_stream_tmpfile function in libjasper/base/jas_stream.c in JasPer 1.900.1 allows local users to cause a denial of service (program exit) by creating the appropriate tmp.XXXXXXXXXX temporary file, which causes Jasper to exit.  NOTE: this was originally reported as a symlink issue, but this was incorrect.  NOTE: some vendors dispute the severity of this issue, but it satisfies CVE's requirements for inclusion.",
