  "candidate": "CVE-2013-6167",
  "description": "Mozilla Firefox through 27 sends HTTP Cookie headers without first validating that they have the required character-set restrictions, which allows remote attackers to conduct the equivalent of a persistent Logout CSRF attack via a crafted parameter that forces a web application to set a malformed cookie within an HTTP response.",
  "notes": {
    "chrisccoulson": "The upstream Mozilla bug is marked as wontfix. This only affects cookies set via document.cookie (A similar issue for cookies set via the HTTP Set-Cookie header was fixed in CVE-2016-1939)"
