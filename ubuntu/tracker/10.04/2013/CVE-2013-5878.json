  "candidate": "CVE-2013-5878",
  "description": "Unspecified vulnerability in Oracle Java SE 6u65 and 7u45, Java SE Embedded 7u45, and OpenJDK 7 allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability via unknown vectors related to Security.  NOTE: the previous information is from the January 2014 CPU.  Oracle has not commented on third-party claims that the Security component does not properly handle null XML namespace (xmlns) attributes during XML document canonicalization, which allows attackers to escape the sandbox.",
