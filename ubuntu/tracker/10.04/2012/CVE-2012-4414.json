  "description": "Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in the replication code in Oracle MySQL possibly before 5.5.29, and MariaDB 5.1.x through 5.1.62, 5.2.x through 5.2.12, 5.3.x through 5.3.7, and 5.5.x through 5.5.25, allow remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary SQL commands via vectors related to the binary log.  NOTE: as of 20130116, Oracle has not commented on claims from a downstream vendor that the fix in MySQL 5.5.29 is incomplete.",

    "jdstrand": "mysql-cluster-7.0 not supported per Ubuntu Server team As of 2012/01/09, Oracle no longer supports MySQL 5.0. Unfortunately, because of upstream update and commit policies it is not possible to backport patches from later releases. Ubuntu is regrettably unable to support MySQL 5.0 and users are encouraged to upgrade to Ubuntu 10.04 LTS or later. watch for fix in 5.5.31 Debian released 5.5.30+dfsg-1 claiming to have fixed this issue as of 2013-03-25, no complete fix from upstream",
