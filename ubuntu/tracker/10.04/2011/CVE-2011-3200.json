  "description": "Stack-based buffer overflow in the parseLegacySyslogMsg function in tools/syslogd.c in rsyslogd in rsyslog 4.6.x before 4.6.8 and 5.2.0 through 5.8.4 might allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application exit) via a long TAG in a legacy syslog message.",
  "notes": {
    "jdstrand": "On i386 and amd64 it seems to just truncate messages slightly and not be a DoS. Will patch anyway just in case for other architectures."
