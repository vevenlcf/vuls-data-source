  "candidate": "CVE-2011-2942",
  "description": "A certain Red Hat patch to the __br_deliver function in net/bridge/br_forward.c in the Linux kernel 2.6.18 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact by leveraging connectivity to a network interface that uses an Ethernet bridge device.",
  "ubuntu_description": "Qianfeng Zhang discovered that the bridge networking interface incorrectly handled certain network packets. A remote attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of service.",
  "notes": {
    "apw": "Redhat claims the fix below fixes the issue: bridge: fix use after free in __br_deliver this looks to be fixed upstream by: bridge: Fix netpoll support only a very small part of this delivering the actual fix. This was introduced in the patch below: netpoll: add generic support for bridge and bonding devices For maverick netpoll is re-disabled for bridge by the commit below: bridge: Partially disable netpoll support"
