  "candidate": "CVE-2011-1548",
  "description": "The default configuration of logrotate on Debian GNU/Linux uses root privileges to process files in directories that permit non-root write access, which allows local users to conduct symlink and hard link attacks by leveraging logrotate's lack of support for untrusted directories, as demonstrated by /var/log/postgresql/.",
  "notes": {
    "mdeslaur": "looks like issue #9, adding RH bug upstream patch adds \"su\" option variable, and probably breaks backwards compatibility RH proposed patch for CVE-2011-1098 may fix it in a backwards-compatible way pretty much fixed by nofollow.patch and security-388608.patch in lucid+"
