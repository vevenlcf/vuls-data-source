  "candidate": "CVE-2010-4247",
  "description": "The do_block_io_op function in (1) drivers/xen/blkback/blkback.c and (2) drivers/xen/blktap/blktap.c in Xen before 3.4.0 for the Linux kernel 2.6.18, and possibly other versions, allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (infinite loop and CPU consumption) via a large production request index to the blkback or blktap back-end drivers.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.",
  "ubuntu_description": "It was discovered that Xen did not correctly handle certain block requests. A local attacker in a Xen guest could cause the Xen host to use all available CPU resources, leading to a denial of service.",
  "notes": {
    "jdstrand": "xen-3.1 has linux-2.6-xen-sparse/drivers/xen/blkback/blkback.c, but xen-3.2 and xen-3.3 do not marking dapper task as ignored since we no longer support xen userspace on Dapper anyway",
    "smb": "My feeling is that xen-3.1 has code affected, but does not package that up. That would make only Hardy kernel code truely affected. Oneiric not-affected for now (not containing blkback) and when we move to upstream v3.0 is is fixed there."
