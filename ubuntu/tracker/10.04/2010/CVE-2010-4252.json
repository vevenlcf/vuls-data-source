  "description": "OpenSSL before 1.0.0c, when J-PAKE is enabled, does not properly validate the public parameters in the J-PAKE protocol, which allows remote attackers to bypass the need for knowledge of the shared secret, and successfully authenticate, by sending crafted values in each round of the protocol.",
  "notes": {
    "jdstrand": "Ubuntu 10.04 LTS and later have J-PAKE code, but openssl is compiled with OPENSSL_NO_JPAKE"
