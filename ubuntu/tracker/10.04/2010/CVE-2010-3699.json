  "candidate": "CVE-2010-3699",
  "description": "The backend driver in Xen 3.x allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service via a kernel thread leak, which prevents the device and guest OS from being shut down or create a zombie domain, causes a hang in zenwatch, or prevents unspecified xm commands from working properly, related to (1) netback, (2) blkback, or (3) blktap.",
  "ubuntu_description": "It was discovered that Xen did not correctly clean up threads. A local attacker in a guest system could exploit this to exhaust host system resources, leading to a denial of serivce.",
  "notes": {
    "kees": "The vulnerability described by CVE-2010-3699 probably exists, but I've not been able to reproduce it. It likely requires more block and network devices then I have at my disposal. Checked out http://xenbits.xensource.com/linux-2.6.18-xen.hg and compared. Not all of the original upstream patch was appropriate since it caused a regression with udev."
