  "description": "Red Hat libvirt, possibly 0.7.2 through 0.8.2, recurses into disk-image backing stores without extracting the defined disk backing-store format, which might allow guest OS users to read arbitrary files on the host OS, and possibly have unspecified other impact, via unknown vectors.",
  "notes": {
    "jdstrand": "AppArmor in Ubuntu 10.04 should mostly protect the host OS, but an attacker in a virtual machine may be able to access files of another machine. upstream patch is highly intrusive, needs rewriting for all affected releases, requires a conffile change and a migration helper. Ubuntu 10.04 LTS is the first release to probe the backing stores the changes for CVE-2010-2238 introduced LP: #665531. Upstream has",
    "stated that \"\u003cdriver name='qemu' type='host_device'/": "\" was only accidentally supported and that they do not intend to fix it. Since this used to work on 10.04 LTS and a number of people were affected, a fix will be issued for 10.04 LTS only. Libvirt 0.8.3 (in Ubuntu 10.10) will not support specifying type='host_device'. The discussion can be seen on the libvirt mailing."
