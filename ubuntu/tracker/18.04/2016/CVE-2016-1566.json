  "candidate": "CVE-2016-1566",
  "description": "Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the file browser in Guacamole 0.9.8 and 0.9.9, when file transfer is enabled to a location shared by multiple users, allows remote authenticated users to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a crafted filename.  NOTE: this vulnerability was fixed in guacamole.war on 2016-01-13, but the version number was not changed.",
  "notes": {
    "ebarretto": "Affects client only",
    "seth-arnold": "It looks like the guacamole version numbers are useless: there are both broken versions 0.9.8 and 0.9.9 and fixed versions 0.9.8 and 0.9.9. They apparently make changes and republish with the same version number. Thus I'm being conservative and marking everything as affected."
