{
  "candidate": "CVE-2019-6109",
  "description": "An issue was discovered in OpenSSH 7.9. Due to missing character encoding in the progress display, a malicious server (or Man-in-The-Middle attacker) can employ crafted object names to manipulate the client output, e.g., by using ANSI control codes to hide additional files being transferred. This affects refresh_progress_meter() in progressmeter.c.",
  "notes": {
    "mdeslaur": " The recommended workaround for this issue is to switch to using sftp instead of scp.  The updates in USN-3885-1 inverted two CVE numbers by accident.",
    "seth-arnold": "openssh-ssh1 is provided for compatibility with old devices that cannot be upgraded to modern protocols. Thus we may not provide security support for this package if doing so would prevent access to equipment."
