  "candidate": "CVE-2019-9755",
  "description": "An integer underflow issue exists in ntfs-3g 2017.3.23. A local attacker could potentially exploit this by running /bin/ntfs-3g with specially crafted arguments from a specially crafted directory to cause a heap buffer overflow, resulting in a crash or the ability to execute arbitrary code. In installations where /bin/ntfs-3g is a setuid-root binary, this could lead to a local escalation of privileges.",
  "notes": {
    "chrisccoulson": "This bug only has security implications when ntfs-3g is installed as setuid-root. It's ignored in Ubuntu releases prior to xenial, as it isn't installed as setuid-root in these releases."
