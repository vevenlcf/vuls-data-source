  "candidate": "CVE-2017-3539",
  "description": "Vulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded component of Oracle Java SE (subcomponent: Security). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 6u141, 7u131 and 8u121; Java SE Embedded: 8u121. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Java SE, Java SE Embedded accessible data. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an administrator). CVSS 3.0 Base Score 3.1 (Integrity impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N).",
  "ubuntu_description": "It was discovered that OpenJDK allowed MD5 to be used as an algorithm for JAR integrity verification. An attacker could possibly use this to modify the contents of a JAR file without detection.",
  "notes": {
    "sbeattie": "see openjdk cryptography roadmap https://www.java.com/en/jre-jdk-cryptoroadmap.html update treats JAR files signed with MD5 as unsigned JARs by default. The jdk.jar.disabledAlgorithms security property can be modified to work around this; see the openjdk release notes in the References section for more details."
