{
  "candidate": "CVE-2018-18584",
  "description": "In mspack/cab.h in libmspack before 0.8alpha and cabextract before 1.8, the CAB block input buffer is one byte too small for the maximal Quantum block, leading to an out-of-bounds write.",
  "ubuntu_description": "It was discovered that cabextract incorrectly handled certain malformed CAB files. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause cabextract to crash, resulting in a denial of service.",
  "notes": {
    "amurray": "We released clamav 0.100.2+dfsg-1ubuntu0.1X.04.2 for precise/esm and trusty, but subsequently were notified the bundled libmspack is not actually vulnerable in this case, as the version of libmspack provided had increased the CAB_BLOCKMAX macro to 65535, meaning that CAB_INPUTMAX is now 71679, which is impossible to encode in the 16-bit cfdata_CompressedSize field of a single block."
