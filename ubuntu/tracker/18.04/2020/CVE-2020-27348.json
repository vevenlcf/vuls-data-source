  "candidate": "CVE-2020-27348",
  "description": "In some conditions, a snap package built by snapcraft includes the current directory in LD_LIBRARY_PATH, allowing a malicious snap to gain code execution within the context of another snap if both plug the home interface or similar. This issue affects snapcraft versions prior to 4.4.4, prior to 2.43.1+16.04.1, and prior to 2.43.1+18.04.1.",
  "ubuntu_description": "It was discovered that snapcraft includes the current directory when configuring  LD_LIBRARY_PATH for application commands. If a user were tricked into installing a malicious snap or downloading a malicious library, under certain circumstances an attacker could exploit this to affect strict mode snaps that have access to the library and were launched from the directory containing the library.",
