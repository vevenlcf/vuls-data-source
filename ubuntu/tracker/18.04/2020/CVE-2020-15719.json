  "candidate": "CVE-2020-15719",
  "description": "libldap in certain third-party OpenLDAP packages has a certificate-validation flaw when the third-party package is asserting RFC6125 support. It considers CN even when there is a non-matching subjectAltName (SAN). This is fixed in, for example, openldap-2.4.46-10.el8 in Red Hat Enterprise Linux.",
  "notes": {
    "mdeslaur": "See RH bug for possible regression fixes per upstream bug, this is an issue with a RH patch to openldap and doesn't apply to upstream openldap. Marking as not-affected since Ubuntu does not carry the patch."
