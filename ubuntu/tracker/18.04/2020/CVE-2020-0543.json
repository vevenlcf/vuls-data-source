  "description": "Incomplete cleanup from specific special register read operations in some Intel(R) Processors may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable information disclosure via local access.",
  "ubuntu_description": "It was discovered that memory contents previously stored in microarchitectural special registers after RDRAND, RDSEED, and SGX EGETKEY read operations on Intel client and Xeon E3 processors may be briefly exposed to processes on the same or different processor cores. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information.",
