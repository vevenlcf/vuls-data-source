  "candidate": "CVE-2021-2341",
  "description": "Vulnerability in the Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition product of Oracle Java SE (component: Networking). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 7u301, 8u291, 11.0.11, 16.0.1; Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition: 20.3.2 and 21.1.0. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized read access to a subset of Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition accessible data. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an administrator). CVSS 3.1 Base Score 3.1 (Confidentiality impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).",
  "ubuntu_description": "Varnavas Papaioannou discovered that the FTP client implementation in OpenJDK accepted alternate server IP addresses when connecting with FTP passive mode. An attacker controlling an FTP server that an application connects to could possibly use this to expose sensitive information (rudimentary port scans).",
  "notes": {
    "sbeattie": "the fix for this issue changes the FTP client behavior in OpenJDK. See the Oracle release notes on the new jdk.net.ftp.trustPasvAddress system property that can be set if this breaks PASV commands from an application using the FTP client implementation in OpenJDK."
