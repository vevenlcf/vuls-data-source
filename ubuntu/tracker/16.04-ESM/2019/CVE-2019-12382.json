  "candidate": "CVE-2019-12382",
  "description": "** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in drm_load_edid_firmware in drivers/gpu/drm/drm_edid_load.c in the Linux kernel through 5.1.5. There is an unchecked kstrdup of fwstr, which might allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash). NOTE: The vendor disputes this issues as not being a vulnerability because kstrdup() returning NULL is handled sufficiently and there is no chance for a NULL pointer dereference.",
  "notes": {
    "tyhicks": "There's no security impact here as there's no chance of a NULL pointer derefence. I've requested that MITRE reject this CVE. I've reviewed our Disco, Cosmic, Bionic, and Xenial kernels. There's no security impact here so we'll ignore this issue."
