  "candidate": "CVE-2019-3701",
  "description": "An issue was discovered in can_can_gw_rcv in net/can/gw.c in the Linux kernel through 4.19.13. The CAN frame modification rules allow bitwise logical operations that can be also applied to the can_dlc field. The privileged user \"root\" with CAP_NET_ADMIN can create a CAN frame modification rule that makes the data length code a higher value than the available CAN frame data size. In combination with a configured checksum calculation where the result is stored relatively to the end of the data (e.g. cgw_csum_xor_rel) the tail of the skb (e.g. frag_list pointer in skb_shared_info) can be rewritten which finally can cause a system crash. Because of a missing check, the CAN drivers may write arbitrary content beyond the data registers in the CAN controller's I/O memory when processing can-gw manipulated outgoing frames.",
  "ubuntu_description": "Muyu Yu discovered that the CAN implementation in the Linux kernel in some situations did not properly restrict the field size when processing outgoing frames. A local attacker with CAP_NET_ADMIN privileges could use this to execute arbitrary code.",
  "notes": {
    "tyhicks": "The original CVE description that states that an unprivileged user can trigger a system crash is incorrect. Only the root user, from the init namespace, can trigger the system crash. Therefore, we'll prioritize this issue as negligible."
