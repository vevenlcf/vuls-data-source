    "apw": "this is claimed fixed by RedHat but I cannot find the fix anywhere, the only reference I did find to the CVE in Fedora implies they have miss tagged the fix for CVE-2012-2373 as 2372: http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.linux.redhat.fedora.extras.cvs/775892 note the patch is the x86 pmd patch. needs-triage back to -security for lack of a clear direction on a fix (per irc discussions) Looking at the RHEL kernels it appears that this is the fix, though it is not upstream as yet: http://people.canonical.com/~apw/misc/cves/CVE-2012-2372-1.diff",
