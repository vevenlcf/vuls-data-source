  "candidate": "CVE-2014-6410",
  "description": "The __udf_read_inode function in fs/udf/inode.c in the Linux kernel through 3.16.3 does not restrict the amount of ICB indirection, which allows physically proximate attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop or stack consumption) via a UDF filesystem with a crafted inode.",
  "ubuntu_description": "A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's UDF filesystem (used on some CD-ROMs and DVDs) when processing indirect ICBs. An attacker who can cause CD, DVD or image file with a specially crafted inode to be mounted can cause a denial of service (infinite loop or stack consumption).",
