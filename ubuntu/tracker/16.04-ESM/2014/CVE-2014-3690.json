  "candidate": "CVE-2014-3690",
  "description": "arch/x86/kvm/vmx.c in the KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel before 3.17.2 on Intel processors does not ensure that the value in the CR4 control register remains the same after a VM entry, which allows host OS users to kill arbitrary processes or cause a denial of service (system disruption) by leveraging /dev/kvm access, as demonstrated by PR_SET_TSC prctl calls within a modified copy of QEMU.",
  "ubuntu_description": "A flaw was discovered in how the Linux kernel's KVM (Kernel Virtual Machine) subsystem handles the CR4 control register at VM entry on Intel processors. A local host OS user can exploit this to cause a denial of service (kill arbitrary processes, or system disruption) by leveraging /dev/kvm access.",
