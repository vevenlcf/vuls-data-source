  "candidate": "CVE-2014-4014",
  "description": "The capabilities implementation in the Linux kernel before 3.14.8 does not properly consider that namespaces are inapplicable to inodes, which allows local users to bypass intended chmod restrictions by first creating a user namespace, as demonstrated by setting the setgid bit on a file with group ownership of root.",
  "ubuntu_description": "A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's implementation of user namespaces with respect to inode permissions. A local user could exploit this flaw by creating a user namespace to gain administrative privileges.",
