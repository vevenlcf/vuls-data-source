  "description": "Unspecified vulnerability in NVIDIA graphics driver Release 331, 325, 319, 310, and 304 allows local users to bypass intended access restrictions for the GPU and gain privileges via unknown vectors.",
  "notes": {
    "mdeslaur": "nvidia is not releasing updates for anything other than 304, 319, and 331, so mark others as ignored as there is nothing we can do to fix them. Updating the binary drivers runs the risk of hardware regressions. Since the lts releases now have updated drivers available in the archive, downgrading priority to low"
