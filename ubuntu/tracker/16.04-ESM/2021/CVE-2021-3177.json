{
  "candidate": "CVE-2021-3177",
  "description": "Python 3.x through 3.9.1 has a buffer overflow in PyCArg_repr in _ctypes/callproc.c, which may lead to remote code execution in certain Python applications that accept floating-point numbers as untrusted input, as demonstrated by a 1e300 argument to c_double.from_param. This occurs because sprintf is used unsafely.",
  "notes": {
    "mdeslaur": "on Ubuntu, binaries are compiled with Fortify Source, so exploiting this issue will likely only cause Python to crash, leading to a denial of service."
