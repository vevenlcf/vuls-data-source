{
  "candidate": "CVE-2018-7755",
  "description": "An issue was discovered in the fd_locked_ioctl function in drivers/block/floppy.c in the Linux kernel through 4.15.7. The floppy driver will copy a kernel pointer to user memory in response to the FDGETPRM ioctl. An attacker can send the FDGETPRM ioctl and use the obtained kernel pointer to discover the location of kernel code and data and bypass kernel security protections such as KASLR.",
  "ubuntu_description": "It was discovered that an information leak vulnerability existed in the floppy driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).",
  "notes": {
    "apw": "the above patch mirrors the modifications from the compat path though leaving the name as per the user.  Not progressing upstream.",
