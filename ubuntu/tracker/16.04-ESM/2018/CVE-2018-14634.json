  "description": "An integer overflow flaw was found in the Linux kernel's create_elf_tables() function. An unprivileged local user with access to SUID (or otherwise privileged) binary could use this flaw to escalate their privileges on the system. Kernel versions 2.6.x, 3.10.x and 4.14.x are believed to be vulnerable.",
  "ubuntu_description": "It was discovered that an integer overflow vulnerability existed in the Linux kernel when loading an executable to run. A local attacker could use this to gain administrative privileges.",
  "notes": {
    "tyhicks": "\"Only kernels with commit b6a2fea39318 (\"mm: variable length argument support\", from July 19, 2007) but without commit da029c11e6b1 (\"exec: Limit arg stack to at most 75% of _STK_LIM\", from July 7, 2017) are exploitable.\" This flaw can only be exploited on systems with greater than 32 GB of RAM"
