  "candidate": "CVE-2018-16840",
  "description": "A heap use-after-free flaw was found in curl versions from 7.59.0 through 7.61.1 in the code related to closing an easy handle. When closing and cleaning up an 'easy' handle in the `Curl_close()` function, the library code first frees a struct (without nulling the pointer) and might then subsequently erroneously write to a struct field within that already freed struct.",
