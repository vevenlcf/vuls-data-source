  "candidate": "CVE-2018-10938",
  "description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel present since v4.0-rc1 and through v4.13-rc4. A crafted network packet sent remotely by an attacker may force the kernel to enter an infinite loop in the cipso_v4_optptr() function in net/ipv4/cipso_ipv4.c leading to a denial-of-service. A certain non-default configuration of LSM (Linux Security Module) and NetLabel should be set up on a system before an attacker could leverage this flaw.",
  "ubuntu_description": "Yves Younan discovered that the CIPSO labeling implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle IP header options in some situations. A remote attacker could use this to specially craft network traffic that could cause a denial of service (infinite loop).",
  "notes": {
    "sbeattie": "further hardening discussion (and why it's likely not needed) around this code in the two netdev emails in the marc.info urls in the references section",
    "tyhicks": "This issue affects non-default configurations where SELinux or SMACK is being used instead of AppArmor and networking labeling has been configured. It is unlikely that Ubuntu users would be affected by this issue."
