  "candidate": "CVE-2016-3713",
  "description": "The msr_mtrr_valid function in arch/x86/kvm/mtrr.c in the Linux kernel before 4.6.1 supports MSR 0x2f8, which allows guest OS users to read or write to the kvm_arch_vcpu data structure, and consequently obtain sensitive information or cause a denial of service (system crash), via a crafted ioctl call.",
  "ubuntu_description": "David Matlack discovered that the Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly restrict variable Memory Type Range Registers (MTRR) in KVM guests. A privileged user in a guest VM could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) in the host, expose sensitive information from the host, or possibly gain administrative privileges in the host.",
