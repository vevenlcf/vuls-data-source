  "candidate": "CVE-2016-9604",
  "description": "It was discovered in the Linux kernel before 4.11-rc8 that root can gain direct access to an internal keyring, such as '.dns_resolver' in RHEL-7 or '.builtin_trusted_keys' upstream, by joining it as its session keyring. This allows root to bypass module signature verification by adding a new public key of its own devising to the keyring.",
  "ubuntu_description": "It was discovered that the keyring implementation in the Linux kernel in some situations did not prevent special internal keyrings from being joined by userspace keyrings. A privileged local attacker could use this to bypass module verification.",
