  "candidate": "CVE-2020-24490",
  "description": "Improper buffer restrictions in BlueZ may allow an unauthenticated user to potentially enable denial of service via adjacent access. This affects all Linux kernel versions that support BlueZ.",
  "ubuntu_description": "Andy Nguyen discovered that the Bluetooth HCI event packet parser in the Linux kernel did not properly handle event advertisements of certain sizes, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow. A physically proximate remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
  "notes": {
    "sbeattie": "This issue affected kernels 4.18 and later; as such Ubuntu 20.04's 5.4 kernel was fixed around 2020/09/21, before the advisory was issued. it is asserted that b2cc9761f144e8ef714be8c590603073b80ddc13 made the vulnerability accessible. it's not clear if https://lore.kernel.org/linux-bluetooth/20201016180956.707681-1-luiz.dentz@gmail.com/ is needed as well."
