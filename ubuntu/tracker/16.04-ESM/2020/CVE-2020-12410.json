  "description": "Mozilla developers reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 76 and Firefox ESR 68.8. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird \u003c 68.9.0, Firefox \u003c 77, and Firefox ESR \u003c 68.9.",
