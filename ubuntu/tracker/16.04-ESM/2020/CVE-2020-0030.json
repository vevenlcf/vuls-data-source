  "candidate": "CVE-2020-0030",
  "description": "In binder_thread_release of binder.c, there is a possible use after free due to a race condition. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-145286050References: Upstream kernel",
  "notes": {
    "cascardo": "This seems to be like that since binder was added to the kernel, ie., binder would allow the thread to be freed while its wait member was still in the epoll waitqueue. Description was taken from patch's comment, as it describes the specific race condition that makes this different from CVE-2019-2215. I added the first sentence which would be a fair description of both this CVE and CVE-2019-2215."
