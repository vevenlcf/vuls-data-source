  "candidate": "CVE-2020-10732",
  "description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's implementation of Userspace core dumps. This flaw allows an attacker with a local account to crash a trivial program and exfiltrate private kernel data.",
  "ubuntu_description": "It was discovered that the elf handling code in the Linux kernel did not initialize memory before using it in certain situations. A local attacker could use this to possibly expose sensitive information (kernel memory).",
  "notes": {
    "sbeattie": "original report claimed this was introduced in 4206d3aa1978e44f58bfa4e1c9d8d35cbf19c187, but further investigation by Jann Horn makes the case that 91c3dba7dbc1 is where the real problem is introduced."
