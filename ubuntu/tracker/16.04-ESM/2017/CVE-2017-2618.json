  "description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's handling of clearing SELinux attributes on /proc/pid/attr files before 4.9.10. An empty (null) write to this file can crash the system by causing the system to attempt to access unmapped kernel memory.",
  "ubuntu_description": "It was discovered that SELinux in the Linux kernel did not properly handle empty writes to /proc/pid/attr. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
