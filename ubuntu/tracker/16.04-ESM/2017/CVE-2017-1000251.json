  "candidate": "CVE-2017-1000251",
  "description": "The native Bluetooth stack in the Linux Kernel (BlueZ), starting at the Linux kernel version 2.6.32 and up to and including 4.13.1, are vulnerable to a stack overflow vulnerability in the processing of L2CAP configuration responses resulting in Remote code execution in kernel space.",
  "ubuntu_description": "It was discovered that a buffer overflow existed in the Bluetooth stack of the Linux kernel when handling L2CAP configuration responses. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
  "notes": {
    "sbeattie": "stack-based buffer overflow; stack-protector kernel configuration should result in this being limited to a remote denial of service. initial report claimed introduced in 0e8b207e8a44, but possible vuln code path introduced in f2fcfcd67 cloudy kernels are much lower priority, since they typically don't have bluetooth as a threat."
