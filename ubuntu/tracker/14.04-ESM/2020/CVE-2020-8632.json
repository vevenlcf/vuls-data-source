  "candidate": "CVE-2020-8632",
  "description": "In cloud-init through 19.4, rand_user_password in cloudinit/config/cc_set_passwords.py has a small default pwlen value, which makes it easier for attackers to guess passwords.",
  "notes": {
    "ccdm94": "This CVE has been patched in Xenial ESM. The patch, however, has been added only to the updates pocket, and since cloud-init is only used during first boot (pulling from updates), there should not be a need to add this to the security pocket."
