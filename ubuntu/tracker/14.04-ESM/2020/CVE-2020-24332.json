  "candidate": "CVE-2020-24332",
  "description": "An issue was discovered in TrouSerS through 0.3.14. If the tcsd daemon is started with root privileges, the creation of the system.data file is prone to symlink attacks. The tss user can be used to create or corrupt existing files, which could possibly lead to a DoS attack.",
  "notes": {
    "mdeslaur": "the Debian/Ubuntu package starts tcsd as the tss user, not as root, so this issue doesn't affect default configurations"
