  "candidate": "CVE-2016-5300",
  "description": "The XML parser in Expat does not use sufficient entropy for hash initialization, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via crafted identifiers in an XML document. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2012-0876.",
  "notes": {
    "ebarretto": "tla uses system expat as of 1.3.5+dfsg-15",
    "rodrigo-zaiden": "it is also an incomplete fix for CVE-2012-6702, that followed CVE-2012-0876. libxmltok is not affected by any of these CVEs as it doesn't have the hash functions."
