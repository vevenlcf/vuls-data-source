  "candidate": "CVE-2018-5174",
  "description": "In the Windows 10 April 2018 Update, Windows Defender SmartScreen honors the \"SEE_MASK_FLAG_NO_UI\" flag associated with downloaded files and will not show any UI. Files that are unknown and potentially dangerous will be allowed to run because SmartScreen will not prompt the user for a decision, and if the user is offline all files will be allowed to be opened because Windows won't prompt the user to ask what to do. Firefox incorrectly sets this flag when downloading files, leading to less secure behavior from SmartScreen. Note: this issue only affects Windows 10 users running the April 2018 update or later. It does not affect other Windows users or other operating systems. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird \u003c 52.8, Thunderbird ESR \u003c 52.8, Firefox \u003c 60, and Firefox ESR \u003c 52.8.",
