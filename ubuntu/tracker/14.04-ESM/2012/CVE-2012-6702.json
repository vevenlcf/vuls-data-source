  "candidate": "CVE-2012-6702",
  "description": "Expat, when used in a parser that has not called XML_SetHashSalt or passed it a seed of 0, makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to defeat cryptographic protection mechanisms via vectors involving use of the srand function.",
  "notes": {
    "rodrigo-zaiden": "related to CVE-2012-0876, where the fix added XML_SetHashSalt and generate_hash_secret_salt methods. libxmltok does not have those methods, hence not affected.",
