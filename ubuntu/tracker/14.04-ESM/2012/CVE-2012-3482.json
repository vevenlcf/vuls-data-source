  "description": "Fetchmail 5.0.8 through 6.3.21, when using NTLM authentication in debug mode, allows remote NTLM servers to (1) cause a denial of service (crash and delayed delivery of inbound mail) via a crafted NTLM response that triggers an out-of-bounds read in the base64 decoder, or (2) obtain sensitive information from memory via an NTLM Type 2 message with a crafted Target Name structure, which triggers an out-of-bounds read.",
