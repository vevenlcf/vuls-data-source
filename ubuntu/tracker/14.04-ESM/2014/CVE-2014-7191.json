{
  "candidate": "CVE-2014-7191",
  "description": "The qs module before 1.0.0 in Node.js does not call the compact function for array data, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by using a large index value to create a sparse array.",
  "ubuntu_description": "It was discovered that the qs module in Node.js incorrectly handled inputs. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service.",
  "notes": {
    "ebarretto": "This issue is actually for node-querystring. Somewhere along the line node-qs was born or forked from node-querystring which was deprecated. But now there are again new projects called querystring. Be careful when updating. Trusty's version is actually based on node-querystring."
