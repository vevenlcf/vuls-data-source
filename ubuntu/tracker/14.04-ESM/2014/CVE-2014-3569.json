  "candidate": "CVE-2014-3569",
  "description": "The ssl23_get_client_hello function in s23_srvr.c in OpenSSL 0.9.8zc, 1.0.0o, and 1.0.1j does not properly handle attempts to use unsupported protocols, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and daemon crash) via an unexpected handshake, as demonstrated by an SSLv3 handshake to a no-ssl3 application with certain error handling.  NOTE: this issue became relevant after the CVE-2014-3568 fix.",
  "notes": {
    "mdeslaur": "Ubuntu packages aren't compiled with no-ssl3, so aren't actually vulnerable to this issue."
