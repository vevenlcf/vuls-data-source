  "candidate": "CVE-2014-3484",
  "description": "Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in the __dn_expand function in network/dn_expand.c in musl libc 1.1x before 1.1.2 and 0.9.13 through 1.0.3 allow remote attackers to (1) have unspecified impact via an invalid name length in a DNS response or (2) cause a denial of service (crash) via an invalid name length in a DNS response, related to an infinite loop with no output.",
  "ubuntu_description": "It was discovered that musl did not properly handle the parsing of DNS response codes. An remote attacker could use this vulnerability to cause resource consumption (infinite loop), denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
