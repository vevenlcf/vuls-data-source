  "description": "The collator implementation in i18n/ucol.cpp in International Components for Unicode (ICU) 52 through SVN revision 293126, as used in Google Chrome before 40.0.2214.91, does not initialize memory for a data structure, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted character sequence.",
  "notes": {
    "mdeslaur": "code in icu has changed, so no equivalent commit in icu tree first google patch is buggy, as prevPos is getting set _after_ the getNextNormalizedChar second google patch is buggy as source-\u003eendp is being checked without checking the UCOL_ITER_HASLEN flag"
