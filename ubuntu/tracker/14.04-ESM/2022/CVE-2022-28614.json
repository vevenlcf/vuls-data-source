  "candidate": "CVE-2022-28614",
  "description": "The ap_rwrite() function in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.53 and earlier may read unintended memory if an attacker can cause the server to reflect very large input using ap_rwrite() or ap_rputs(), such as with mod_luas r:puts() function. Modules compiled and distributed separately from Apache HTTP Server that use the 'ap_rputs' function and may pass it a very large (INT_MAX or larger) string must be compiled against current headers to resolve the issue.",
