  "candidate": "CVE-2011-3619",
  "description": "The apparmor_setprocattr function in security/apparmor/lsm.c in the Linux kernel before 3.0 does not properly handle invalid parameters, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and OOPS) or possibly have unspecified other impact by writing to a /proc/#####/attr/current file.",
  "ubuntu_description": "A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's AppArmor security interface when invalid information was written to it. An unprivileged local user could use this to cause a denial of service on the system.",

    "apw": "this was introduced in the version of apparmour in maverick and has already been fixed after that"
