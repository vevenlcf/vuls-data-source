  "candidate": "CVE-2021-20269",
  "description": "A flaw was found in the permissions of a log file created by kexec-tools. This flaw allows a local unprivileged user to read this file and leak kernel internal information from a previous panic. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality. This flaw affects kexec-tools shipped by Fedora versions prior to 2.0.21-8 and RHEL versions prior to 2.0.20-47.",
  "notes": {
    "sbeattie": "on ubuntu/debian, makedumpfile from src:makedumpfile is used to create the dmesg file, and correctly limits the permissions on it. On Fedora/RedHat, the kdump-lib-initramfs.sh is used and is where the vulnerability lies. This script is not included in ubuntu/debian packaging."
