    "mdeslaur": "The pngimage utility is only used during build to test well-known inputs. It is not shipped in the resulting binary packages, so while the vulnerable code exists in the libpng1.6 source package it is not used in an insecure way and is not present on end-user systems. Marking as not-affected. Code is not compiled at all in firefox."
