  "candidate": "CVE-2016-5386",
  "description": "The net/http package in Go through 1.6 does not attempt to address RFC 3875 section 4.1.18 namespace conflicts and therefore does not protect CGI applications from the presence of untrusted client data in the HTTP_PROXY environment variable, which might allow remote attackers to redirect a CGI application's outbound HTTP traffic to an arbitrary proxy server via a crafted Proxy header in an HTTP request, aka an \"httpoxy\" issue.",
  "notes": {
    "mdeslaur": "Packages built using golang need to be rebuilt once the vulnerability has been fixed. This CVE entry does not list packages that need rebuilding outside of the main repository or the Ubuntu variants with PPA overlays."
