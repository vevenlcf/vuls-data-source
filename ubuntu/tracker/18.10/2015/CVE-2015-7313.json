  "description": "LibTIFF allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption and crash) via a crafted tiff file.",
  "notes": {
    "ccdm94": "bionic and later are not-affected and the issue is not reproducible in trusty (no huge reallocs are made, as would be expected), and is also not reproducible in xenial (no reallocs made at all, according to ltrace output) with the POC file provided in the oss-security post. No upstream patch was identified after analysis of the libtiff changelog file, as well as the change history for the tiffdither code. Since this is a 2015 issue, trusty and xenial will be marked as ignored.",
