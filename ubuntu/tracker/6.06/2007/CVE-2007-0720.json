  "candidate": "CVE-2007-0720",
  "description": "The CUPS service on multiple platforms allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (service hang) via a \"partially-negotiated\" SSL connection, which prevents other requests from being accepted.",
  "notes": {
    "kees": "The \"fix\" isn't really a fix, and just worsens the diagnostics available to an admin seeking the DoS.  This is a design problem with CUPS."
