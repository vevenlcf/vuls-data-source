  "candidate": "CVE-2007-2452",
  "description": "Heap-based buffer overflow in the visit_old_format function in locate/locate.c in locate in GNU findutils before 4.2.31 might allow context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long pathname in a locate database that has the old format, a different vulnerability than CVE-2001-1036.",
  "notes": {
    "kees": "slocate runs instead of the findutils, and this would require an root-user-owned-db attack or similar."
