  "candidate": "CVE-2008-5395",
  "description": "The parisc_show_stack function in arch/parisc/kernel/traps.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.28-rc7 on PA-RISC allows local users to cause a denial of service (system crash) via vectors associated with an attempt to unwind a stack that contains userspace addresses.",
  "ubuntu_description": "Helge Deller discovered that PA-RISC stack unwinding was not handled correctly. A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading do a denial of service. This did not affect official Ubuntu kernels, but was fixed in the source for anyone performing HPPA kernel builds.",
  "notes": {
    "smb": "The call do dump_stack was not added before v2.6.25-rc6. So the resulting panic will not happen."
