  "description": "Memory leak in the ipip6_rcv function in net/ipv6/sit.c in the Linux kernel 2.4 before 2.4.36.5 and 2.6 before 2.6.25.3 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via network traffic to a Simple Internet Transition (SIT) tunnel interface, related to the pskb_may_pull and kfree_skb functions, and management of an skb reference count.",
  "ubuntu_description": "Paul Marks discovered that the SIT interfaces did not correctly manage allocated memory.  A remote attacker could exploit this to fill all available memory, leading to a denial of service.",
