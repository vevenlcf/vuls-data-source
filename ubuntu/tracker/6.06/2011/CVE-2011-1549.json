  "candidate": "CVE-2011-1549",
  "description": "The default configuration of logrotate on Gentoo Linux uses root privileges to process files in directories that permit non-root write access, which allows local users to conduct symlink and hard link attacks by leveraging logrotate's lack of support for untrusted directories, as demonstrated by directories under /var/log/ for packages.",
