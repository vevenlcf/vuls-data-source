  "candidate": "CVE-2005-4134",
  "description": "Mozilla Firefox 1.5, Netscape 8.0.4 and 7.2, and K-Meleon before 0.9.12 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption and delayed application startup) via a web site with a large title, which is recorded in history.dat but not processed efficiently during startup. NOTE: despite initial reports, the Mozilla vendor does not believe that this issue can be used to trigger a crash or buffer overflow in Firefox. Also, it has been independently reported that Netscape 8.1 does not have this issue.",
