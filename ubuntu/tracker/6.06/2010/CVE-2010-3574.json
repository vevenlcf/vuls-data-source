  "description": "Unspecified vulnerability in the Networking component in Oracle Java SE and Java for Business 6 Update 21, 5.0 Update 25, 1.4.2_27, and 1.3.1_28 allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability via unknown vectors.  NOTE: the previous information was obtained from the October 2010 CPU.  Oracle has not commented on claims from a reliable downstream vendor that HttpURLConnection does not properly check for the allowHttpTrace permission, which allows untrusted code to perform HTTP TRACE requests.",
