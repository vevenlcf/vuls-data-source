  "description": "WebKit, as used in Apple Safari before 4.1.3 and 5.0.x before 5.0.3, Google Chrome before 6.0.472.53, and webkitgtk before 1.2.6, does not properly restrict read access to images derived from CANVAS elements, which allows remote attackers to bypass the Same Origin Policy and obtain potentially sensitive image data via a crafted web site.",
  "notes": {
    "jdstrand": "qt4-x11 unmaintained upstream (see README.webkit for details) webkit is a fork of khtml from kdelibs. kdelibs5 is farther from it, while qt4-x11 attempts to unify khtml and webkit.",
