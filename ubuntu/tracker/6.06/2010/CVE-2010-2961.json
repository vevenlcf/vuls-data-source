  "candidate": "CVE-2010-2961",
  "description": "mountall.c in mountall before 2.15.2 uses 0666 permissions for the root.rules file, which allows local users to gain privileges by modifying this file.",
  "ubuntu_description": "Alasdair MacGregor discovered that mountall created a udev rule file with world-writable permissions. A local attacker could exploit this under certain conditions to cause udev to execute arbitrary commands as the root user.",
  "notes": {
    "kees": "luckily, udev doesn't use inotify on this directory at boot time, so udev needs to be reloaded before this is really ugly."
