  "candidate": "CVE-2010-2524",
  "description": "The DNS resolution functionality in the CIFS implementation in the Linux kernel before 2.6.35, when CONFIG_CIFS_DFS_UPCALL is enabled, relies on a user's keyring for the dns_resolver upcall in the cifs.upcall userspace helper, which allows local users to spoof the results of DNS queries and perform arbitrary CIFS mounts via vectors involving an add_key call, related to a \"cache stuffing\" issue and MS-DFS referrals.",
  "ubuntu_description": "David Howells discovered that DNS resolution in CIFS could be spoofed. A local attacker could exploit this to control DNS replies, leading to a loss of privacy and possible privilege escalation.",
  "notes": {
    "sbeattie": "according to oss-security discussion, git commit 6103335de8afa5d780dcd512abe85c696af7b040 introduced the problem, so 2.6.25-rc1 onwards.",
    "smb": "Jaunty *may* be affected, but the problem is that there is no infra- structure for thread credentials, so even if it is possible to back- port the whole thing it would be completely different and prone to be incorrect. That together with the fact that Jaunty is EOL more or less I don't think we should put in much effort there."
