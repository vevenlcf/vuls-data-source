  "description": "Mozilla Firefox 3.5.x through 3.5.14 and 3.6.x through 3.6.11, Thunderbird 3.1.6 before 3.1.6 and 3.0.x before 3.0.10, and SeaMonkey 2.x before 2.0.10, when JavaScript is enabled, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via vectors related to nsCSSFrameConstructor::ContentAppended, the appendChild method, incorrect index tracking, and the creation of multiple frames, which triggers memory corruption, as exploited in the wild in October 2010 by the Belmoo malware.",
  "notes": {
    "jdstrand": "0-day exploit in wild for Windows. Presumed that other platforms will follow soon. It is unclear if compiler and kernel protections will protect against this, and upstream considers this extremely serious."
