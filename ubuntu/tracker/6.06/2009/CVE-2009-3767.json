  "candidate": "CVE-2009-3767",
  "description": "libraries/libldap/tls_o.c in OpenLDAP 2.2 and 2.4, and possibly other versions, when OpenSSL is used, does not properly handle a '\\0' character in a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) field of an X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof arbitrary SSL servers via a crafted certificate issued by a legitimate Certification Authority, a related issue to CVE-2009-2408.",
  "notes": {
    "mdeslaur": "openldap in hardy and intrepid only have gnutls backend we compile jaunty-lucid with gnutls, not openssl so we're not vulnerable to this. (debian/configure.options)  openldap2 in dapper has been patched with gnutls support, so not vulnerable. This is the library to which all dapper applications are linked, to not conflict with the openssl license.  openldap2.2 in dapper uses openssl and is vulnerable."
