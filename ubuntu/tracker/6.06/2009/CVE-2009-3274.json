  "candidate": "CVE-2009-3274",
  "description": "Mozilla Firefox 3.6a1, 3.5.3, 3.5.2, and earlier 3.5.x versions, and 3.0.14 and earlier 2.x and 3.x versions, on Linux uses a predictable /tmp pathname for files selected from the Downloads window, which allows local users to replace an arbitrary downloaded file by placing a file in a /tmp location before the download occurs, related to the Download Manager component. NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.",
  "notes": {
    "jdstrand": "CVEs in Firefox are tracked in the xulrunner source packages. The mapping of xulrunner sources to firefox is: xulrunner (1.8.0): firefox (1.5) - Ubuntu 6.06 LTS xulrunner (1.8.1): firefox (2.0) - Ubuntu 6.10 - 8.04 LTS xulrunner-1.9: firefox-3.0 xulrunner-1.9.1: firefox-3.5 Ubuntu 6.06 LTS and 10.04 LTS uses the embedded xulrunner and not the system xulrunner-1.9.2, so it is tracked in the firefox source package."
