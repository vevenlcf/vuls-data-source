  "candidate": "CVE-2009-0859",
  "description": "The shm_get_stat function in ipc/shm.c in the shm subsystem in the Linux kernel before 2.6.28.5, when CONFIG_SHMEM is disabled, misinterprets the data type of an inode, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (system hang) via an SHM_INFO shmctl call, as demonstrated by running the ipcs program.",
  "ubuntu_description": "The shared memory subsystem did not correctly handle certain shmctl calls when CONFIG_SHMEM was disabled.  Ubuntu kernels were not vulnerable, since CONFIG_SHMEM is enabled by default.",
