{
  "candidate": "CVE-2004-1038",
  "description": "A design error in the IEEE1394 specification allows attackers with physical access to a device to read and write to sensitive memory using a modified FireWire/IEEE 1394 client, thus bypassing intended restrictions that would normally require greater degrees of physical access to exploit.  NOTE: this was reported in 2008 to affect Windows Vista, but some Linux-based operating systems have protection mechanisms against this attack.",
  "notes": {
    "kees": "This is a physical design issue with Firewire.  It can be mitigated via setting \"options ohci1394 phys_dma=0\" in a /etc/modprobe.d/ file, though this will greatly reduce the speed of your Firewire."
