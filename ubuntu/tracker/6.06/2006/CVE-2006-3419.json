  "candidate": "CVE-2006-3419",
  "description": "Tor before 0.1.1.20 uses OpenSSL pseudo-random bytes (RAND_pseudo_bytes) instead of cryptographically strong RAND_bytes, and seeds the entropy value at start-up with 160-bit chunks without reseeding, which makes it easier for attackers to conduct brute force guessing attacks.",
