  "candidate": "CVE-2015-1799",
  "description": "The symmetric-key feature in the receive function in ntp_proto.c in ntpd in NTP 3.x and 4.x before 4.2.8p2 performs state-variable updates upon receiving certain invalid packets, which makes it easier for man-in-the-middle attackers to cause a denial of service (synchronization loss) by spoofing the source IP address of a peer.",
  "notes": {
    "mdeslaur": "we will not be backporting this issue to the codebase in lucid before it goes end-of-life. Marking as ignored."
