  "description": "Adobe Flash Player before 18.0.0.241 and 19.x before 19.0.0.185 on Windows and OS X and before 11.2.202.521 on Linux, Adobe AIR before 19.0.0.190, Adobe AIR SDK before 19.0.0.190, and Adobe AIR SDK \u0026 Compiler before 19.0.0.190 do not properly restrict the SWF file format, which allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks against JSONP endpoints, and obtain sensitive information, via a crafted OBJECT element with SWF content satisfying the character-set requirements of a callback API.  NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2014-4671 and CVE-2014-5333.",
