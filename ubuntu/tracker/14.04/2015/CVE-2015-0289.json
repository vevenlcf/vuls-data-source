  "candidate": "CVE-2015-0289",
  "description": "The PKCS#7 implementation in OpenSSL before 0.9.8zf, 1.0.0 before 1.0.0r, 1.0.1 before 1.0.1m, and 1.0.2 before 1.0.2a does not properly handle a lack of outer ContentInfo, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and application crash) by leveraging an application that processes arbitrary PKCS#7 data and providing malformed data with ASN.1 encoding, related to crypto/pkcs7/pk7_doit.c and crypto/pkcs7/pk7_lib.c.",
