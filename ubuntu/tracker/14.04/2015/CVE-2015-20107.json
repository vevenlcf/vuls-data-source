  "candidate": "CVE-2015-20107",
  "description": "In Python (aka CPython) through 3.10.4, the mailcap module does not add escape characters into commands discovered in the system mailcap file. This may allow attackers to inject shell commands into applications that call mailcap.findmatch with untrusted input (if they lack validation of user-provided filenames or arguments).",
  "notes": {
    "leosilva": "patch was proposed in cpython Lib/mailcap.py but not merged yet. it sounds a better approach was PR to fix that issue, but still not merged yet. there are plenty of discussions going on about proper ways to fix that issue, but none was accept yet that fix the issue and keep the software working properly."
