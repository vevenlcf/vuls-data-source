  "description": "Race condition in the _get_masked_mode function in Lib/os.py in Python 3.2 through 3.5, when exist_ok is set to true and multiple threads are used, might allow local users to bypass intended file permissions by leveraging a separate application vulnerability before the umask has been set to the expected value.",
  "notes": {
    "mdeslaur": "introduced by the fix for http://bugs.python.org/issue9299 upstream commited a better fix than the proposed one in the bug but it now changes behavour",
    "seth-arnold": "The upstream patch uses umask(0022) instead of umask(0) -- which seems as bad as the original behaviour. We should see if there is an updated patch when we prepare our packages that replaces the bad code."
