  "candidate": "CVE-2014-0105",
  "description": "The auth_token middleware in the OpenStack Python client library for Keystone (aka python-keystoneclient) before 0.7.0 does not properly retrieve user tokens from memcache, which allows remote authenticated users to gain privileges in opportunistic circumstances via a large number of requests, related to an \"interaction between eventlet and python-memcached.\"",
  "notes": {
    "jdstrand": "According to upstream, this is difficult to reliably attack since it is dependent on server interactions code present in keystone in Essex and Folsom, python-keystoneclient in Grizzly and higher"
