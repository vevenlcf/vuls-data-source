  "description": "Adobe Flash Player before 13.0.0.241 and 14.x before 14.0.0.176 on Windows and OS X and before 11.2.202.400 on Linux, Adobe AIR before 14.0.0.178 on Windows and OS X and before 14.0.0.179 on Android, Adobe AIR SDK before 14.0.0.178, and Adobe AIR SDK \u0026 Compiler before 14.0.0.178 do not properly restrict the SWF file format, which allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks against JSONP endpoints, and obtain sensitive information, via a crafted OBJECT element with SWF content satisfying the character-set requirements of a callback API, in conjunction with a manipulation involving a '$' (dollar sign) or '(' (open parenthesis) character. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2014-4671.",
