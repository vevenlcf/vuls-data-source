  "candidate": "CVE-2014-5439",
  "description": "Multiple Stack-based Buffer Overflow vulnerabilities exists in Sniffit prior to 0.3.7 via a crafted configuration file that will bypass Non-eXecutable bit NX, stack smashing protector SSP, and address space layout randomization ASLR protection mechanisms, which could let a malicious user execute arbitrary code.",
  "ubuntu_description": "It was discovered that SniffIt incorrectly handled certain configuration files. An attacker could possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary code.",
  "notes": {
    "sbeattie": "sniffit is not setuid, so this issue only affects configurations where a user is only permitted to run a subset of administrative (e.g. using a sudo configuration that only allows a user to run sniffit)."
