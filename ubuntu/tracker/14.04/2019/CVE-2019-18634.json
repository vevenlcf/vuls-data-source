  "candidate": "CVE-2019-18634",
  "description": "In Sudo before 1.8.26, if pwfeedback is enabled in /etc/sudoers, users can trigger a stack-based buffer overflow in the privileged sudo process. (pwfeedback is a default setting in Linux Mint and elementary OS; however, it is NOT the default for upstream and many other packages, and would exist only if enabled by an administrator.) The attacker needs to deliver a long string to the stdin of getln() in tgetpass.c.",
  "notes": {
    "mdeslaur": "pwfeedback is not enabled in Ubuntu affects 1.7.1 to 1.8.25p1 as it can't be exploited in 1.8.26 to 1.8.30"
