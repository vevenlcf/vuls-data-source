  "candidate": "CVE-2019-9514",
  "description": "Some HTTP/2 implementations are vulnerable to a reset flood, potentially leading to a denial of service. The attacker opens a number of streams and sends an invalid request over each stream that should solicit a stream of RST_STREAM frames from the peer. Depending on how the peer queues the RST_STREAM frames, this can consume excess memory, CPU, or both.",
  "ubuntu_description": "It was discovered that Netty incorrectly implements HTTP/2. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service.",
  "notes": {
    "mdeslaur": "Packages built using golang need to be rebuilt once the vulnerability has been fixed. This CVE entry does not list packages that need rebuilding outside of the main repository or the Ubuntu variants with PPA overlays.",
