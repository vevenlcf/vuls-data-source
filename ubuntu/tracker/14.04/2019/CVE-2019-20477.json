  "candidate": "CVE-2019-20477",
  "description": "PyYAML 5.1 through 5.1.2 has insufficient restrictions on the load and load_all functions because of a class deserialization issue, e.g., Popen is a class in the subprocess module. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2017-18342.",
  "notes": {
    "mdeslaur": "CVE-2017-18342 resulted in the load() function being deprecated in 5.1+ in eoan and later. It did not get fixed in previous release because of compatibility issues. This CVE therefore only really applies to eoan and later."
