  "candidate": "CVE-2020-27748",
  "description": "A flaw was found in the xdg-email component of xdg-utils-1.1.0-rc1 and newer. When handling mailto: URIs, xdg-email allows attachments to be discreetly added via the URI when being passed to Thunderbird. An attacker could potentially send a victim a URI that automatically attaches a sensitive file to a new email. If a victim user does not notice that an attachment was added and sends the email, this could result in sensitive information disclosure. It has been confirmed that the code behind this issue is in xdg-email and not in Thunderbird.",
  "notes": {
    "leosilva": "the patch was made in a stable release removing the functionality of --attach in thuderbird and other applications we decided to mark it as ignored since it causes regression cross applications. Also, considers it not as medium since the attach ability requires users permissions."
