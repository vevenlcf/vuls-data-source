  "candidate": "CVE-2021-24000",
  "description": "A race condition with requestPointerLock() and setTimeout() could have resulted in a user interacting with one tab when they believed they were on a separate tab. In conjunction with certain elements (such as \u0026lt;input type=\"file\"\u0026gt;) this could have led to an attack where a user was confused about the origin of the webpage and potentially disclosed information they did not intend to. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 88.",
