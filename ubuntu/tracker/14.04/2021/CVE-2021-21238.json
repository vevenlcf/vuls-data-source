  "candidate": "CVE-2021-21238",
  "description": "PySAML2 is a pure python implementation of SAML Version 2 Standard. PySAML2 before 6.5.0 has an improper verification of cryptographic signature vulnerability. All users of pysaml2 that need to validate signed SAML documents are impacted. The vulnerability is a variant of XML Signature wrapping because it did not validate the SAML document against an XML schema. This allowed invalid XML documents to be processed and such a document can trick pysaml2 with a wrapped signature. This is fixed in PySAML2 6.5.0.",
  "notes": {
    "mdeslaur": "Fixing this requires the python-xmlschema package, which is only available on hirsute. Backporting this fix to stable releases is intrusive and may introduce regressions."
