  "description": "DL::dlopen in Ruby 1.8, 1.9.0, 1.9.2, 1.9.3, 2.0.0 before patchlevel 648, and 2.1 before 2.1.8 opens libraries with tainted names.",
  "notes": {
    "mdeslaur": "DL was removed in 2.2 This is the same issue as CVE-2015-7551, except only for 1.9.1",
    "seth-arnold": "The Debian triage mentions two points, first that the upstream fix has been dropped from upstream for unknown reasons; second, Fiddle in Ruby 2.2 has the same problem. MITRE hasn't (yet?) assigned a CVE for 7269e3de3cee3bbb6ab77fc708f3a10cab00b65e but that may be for their own reasons."
