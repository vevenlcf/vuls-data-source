  "candidate": "CVE-2006-7243",
  "description": "PHP before 5.3.4 accepts the \\0 character in a pathname, which might allow context-dependent attackers to bypass intended access restrictions by placing a safe file extension after this character, as demonstrated by .php\\0.jpg at the end of the argument to the file_exists function.",
  "notes": {
    "sbeattie": "upstream only prepared a fix for the 5.3 tree. Backporting the fix to 5.2.x requires modifying php APIs."
