  "candidate": "CVE-2010-4256",
  "description": "The pipe_fcntl function in fs/pipe.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.37 does not properly determine whether a file is a named pipe, which allows local users to cause a denial of service via an F_SETPIPE_SZ fcntl call.",
  "ubuntu_description": "It was discovered that named pipes did not correctly handle certain fcntl calls. A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of service.",
  "notes": {
    "apw": "it was introduced by commit 35f3d14dbbc58447c61e38a162ea10add6b31dc7 \"pipe: add support for shrinking and growing pipes\" which was introduced in v2.6.35-rc1",
