  "description": "WebKit in Apple Safari before 5.0 on Mac OS X 10.5 through 10.6 and Windows, and before 4.1 on Mac OS X 10.4, does not properly handle changes to keyboard focus that occur during processing of key press events, which allows remote attackers to force arbitrary key presses via a crafted HTML document.",

    "jdstrand": "qt4-x11 unmaintained upstream (see README.webkit for details) webkit is a fork of khtml from kdelibs. kdelibs5 is farther from it, while qt4-x11 attempts to unify khtml and webkit.",
