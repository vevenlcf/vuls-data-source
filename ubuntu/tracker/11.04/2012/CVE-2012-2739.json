  "description": "Oracle Java SE before 7 Update 6, and OpenJDK 7 before 7u6 build 12 and 8 before build 39, computes hash values without restricting the ability to trigger hash collisions predictably, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via crafted input to an application that maintains a hash table.",
