  "candidate": "CVE-2012-0216",
  "description": "The default configuration of the apache2 package in Debian GNU/Linux squeeze before 2.2.16-6+squeeze7, wheezy before 2.2.22-4, and sid before 2.2.22-4, when mod_php or mod_rivet is used, provides example scripts under the doc/ URI, which might allow local users to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, gain privileges, or obtain sensitive information via vectors involving localhost HTTP requests to the Apache HTTP Server.",
  "notes": {
    "mdeslaur": "fixing this requires a conf file change, which we try not to do in security updates. Marking as ignored since we will not fix this in stable releases. Workaround is simply for the admin to remove the doc directory in the conf files."
