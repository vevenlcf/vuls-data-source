  "candidate": "CVE-2012-2213",
  "description": "** DISPUTED ** Squid 3.1.9 allows remote attackers to bypass the access configuration for the CONNECT method by providing an arbitrary allowed hostname in the Host HTTP header.  NOTE: this issue might not be reproducible, because the researcher is unable to provide a squid.conf file for a vulnerable system, and the observed behavior is consistent with a squid.conf file that was (perhaps inadvertently) designed to allow access based on a \"req_header Host\" acl regex that matches www.uol.com.br.",
  "notes": {
    "mdeslaur": "Need to check, see reproducer in original post Disputed, so ignored.",
    "sbeattie": "dropping to low, as it requires a specific configuration using Host header filtering also, upstream does not have a fix for this.",
    "seth-arnold": "still unable to find a configuration that could demonstrate the problem; as of 2013-01-28, no fix from upstream either."
