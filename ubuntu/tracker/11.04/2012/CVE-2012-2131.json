  "candidate": "CVE-2012-2131",
  "description": "Multiple integer signedness errors in crypto/buffer/buffer.c in OpenSSL 0.9.8v allow remote attackers to conduct buffer overflow attacks, and cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact, via crafted DER data, as demonstrated by an X.509 certificate or an RSA public key.
