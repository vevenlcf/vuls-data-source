  "candidate": "CVE-2011-1945",
  "description": "The elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) subsystem in OpenSSL 1.0.0d and earlier, when the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) is used for the ECDHE_ECDSA cipher suite, does not properly implement curves over binary fields, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to determine private keys via a timing attack and a lattice calculation.",
  "notes": {
    "jdstrand": "from upstream: \"The OpenSSL team have reviewed the paper, and although the result is significant, we believe that the affected code (ECDSA used with binary curves) is very rarely used at present. We therefore do not plan on issuing a security release but expect to patch this in the future.\""
