  "candidate": "CVE-2011-1093",
  "description": "The dccp_rcv_state_process function in net/dccp/input.c in the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) implementation in the Linux kernel before 2.6.38 does not properly handle packets for a CLOSED endpoint, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and OOPS) by sending a DCCP-Close packet followed by a DCCP-Reset packet.",
  "ubuntu_description": "Johan Hovold discovered that the DCCP network stack did not correctly handle certain packet combinations. A remote attacker could send specially crafted network traffic that would crash the system, leading to a denial of service.",
  "notes": {
    "kees": "May have been introduced as late as 0c10c5d. Was possibly fixed briefly by ddab055, but re-introduced by 410e27a."
