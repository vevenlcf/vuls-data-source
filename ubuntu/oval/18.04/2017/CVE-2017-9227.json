  "title": "CVE-2017-9227 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium.",
  "description": "An issue was discovered in Oniguruma 6.2.0, as used in Oniguruma-mod in Ruby through 2.4.1 and mbstring in PHP through 7.1.5. A stack out-of-bounds read occurs in mbc_enc_len() during regular expression searching. Invalid handling of reg-\u003edmin in forward_search_range() could result in an invalid pointer dereference, as an out-of-bounds read from a stack buffer. It was discovered that Oniguruma incorrectly handled certain regular expressions. An attacker could possibly use this issue to obtain sensitive information, cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2017-9227` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibonig4 - 6.3.0-1\nNo subscription required",
