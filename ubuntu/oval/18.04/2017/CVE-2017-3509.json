  "title": "CVE-2017-3509 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium.",
  "description": "Vulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded component of Oracle Java SE (subcomponent: Networking). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 6u141, 7u131 and 8u121; Java SE Embedded: 8u121. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Java SE, Java SE Embedded accessible data as well as unauthorized read access to a subset of Java SE, Java SE Embedded accessible data. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an administrator). CVSS 3.0 Base Score 4.2 (Confidentiality and Integrity impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N). It was discovered that OpenJDK improperly re-used cached NTLM connections in some situations. A remote attacker could possibly use this to cause a Java application to perform actions with the credentials of a different user.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2017-3509` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nopenjdk-8-demo - 8u131-b11-1\nopenjdk-8-jdk - 8u131-b11-1\nopenjdk-8-jdk-headless - 8u131-b11-1\nopenjdk-8-jre - 8u131-b11-1\nopenjdk-8-jre-headless - 8u131-b11-1\nopenjdk-8-jre-zero - 8u131-b11-1\nopenjdk-8-source - 8u131-b11-1\nNo subscription required",
