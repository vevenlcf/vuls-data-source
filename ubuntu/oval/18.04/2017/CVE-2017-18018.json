  "title": "CVE-2017-18018 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - low.",
  "description": "In GNU Coreutils through 8.29, chown-core.c in chown and chgrp does not prevent replacement of a plain file with a symlink during use of the POSIX \"-R -L\" options, which allows local users to modify the ownership of arbitrary files by leveraging a race condition.",
  "note": "ccdm94\u003e It seems like this will not be fixed upstream (due to the nature of the chown and chgrp utilities), the available patch being a documentation change to warn users about insecure software behavior when certain options are used together in chown and chgrp. For this reason, we will not be fixing this issue in releases where it would be needed. These will be marked as ignored.",
