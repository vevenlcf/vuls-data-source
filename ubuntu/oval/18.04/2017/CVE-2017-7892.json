  "description": "Sandstorm Cap'n Proto before 0.5.3.1 allows remote crashes related to a compiler optimization. A remote attacker can trigger a segfault in a 32-bit libcapnp application because Cap'n Proto relies on pointer arithmetic calculations that overflow. An example compiler with optimization that elides a bounds check in such calculations is Apple LLVM version 8.1.0 (clang-802.0.41). The attack vector is a crafted far pointer within a message. Kenton Varda discovered that the Cap'n Proto utility has a buffer overflow vulnerability. An attacker could use this vulnerability to cause a crash or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2017-7892` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ncapnproto - 0.6.1-1\nlibcapnp-0.6.1 - 0.6.1-1\nNo subscription required",
