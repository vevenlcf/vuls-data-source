  "title": "CVE-2017-7652 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium.",
  "description": "In Eclipse Mosquitto 1.4.14, if a Mosquitto instance is set running with a configuration file, then sending a HUP signal to server triggers the configuration to be reloaded from disk. If there are lots of clients connected so that there are no more file descriptors/sockets available (default limit typically 1024 file descriptors on Linux), then opening the configuration file will fail. It was discovered that Mosquitto incorrectly handled file descriptors. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2017-7652` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibmosquitto1 - 1.4.15-1\nlibmosquittopp1 - 1.4.15-1\nmosquitto - 1.4.15-1\nmosquitto-clients - 1.4.15-1\nNo subscription required",
