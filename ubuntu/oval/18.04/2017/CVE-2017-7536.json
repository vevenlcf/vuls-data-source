  "title": "CVE-2017-7536 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium.",
  "description": "In Hibernate Validator 5.2.x before 5.2.5 final, 5.3.x, and 5.4.x, it was found that when the security manager's reflective permissions, which allows it to access the private members of the class, are granted to Hibernate Validator, a potential privilege escalation can occur. By allowing the calling code to access those private members without the permission an attacker may be able to validate an invalid instance and access the private member value via ConstraintViolation#getInvalidValue().\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2017-7536` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibhibernate-validator-java - 4.3.3-4\nNo subscription required",
