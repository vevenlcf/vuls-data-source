  "title": "CVE-2017-9937 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - negligible.",
  "description": "In LibTIFF 4.0.8, there is a memory malloc failure in tif_jbig.c. A crafted TIFF document can lead to an abort resulting in a remote denial of service attack.",
  "note": "mdeslaur\u003e reported in libtiff, but issue lies in jbigkit as of 2018-03-22, no fix available  this is a DoS only and is caused by the fact that jbigkit handles failed memory allocations with abort(). (See checked_malloc()). Fixing this properly would likely require changing the library ABI.",
