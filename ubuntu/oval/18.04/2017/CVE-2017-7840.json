  "description": "JavaScript can be injected into an exported bookmarks file by placing JavaScript code into user-supplied tags in saved bookmarks. If the resulting exported HTML file is later opened in a browser this JavaScript will be executed. This could be used in social engineering and self-cross-site-scripting (self-XSS) attacks if users were convinced to add malicious tags to bookmarks, export them, and then open the resulting file. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 57.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2017-7840` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nfirefox - 57.0.1+build2-0ubuntu1\nfirefox-geckodriver - 57.0.1+build2-0ubuntu1\nfirefox-mozsymbols - 57.0.1+build2-0ubuntu1\nNo subscription required",
