  "title": "CVE-2017-9780 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium.",
  "description": "In Flatpak before 0.8.7, a third-party app repository could include malicious apps that contain files with inappropriate permissions, for example setuid or world-writable. The files are deployed with those permissions, which would let a local attacker run the setuid executable or write to the world-writable location. In the case of the \"system helper\" component, files deployed as part of the app are owned by root, so in the worst case they could be setuid root.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2017-9780` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nflatpak - 1.0.1-0ubuntu0.1\nflatpak-tests - 1.0.1-0ubuntu0.1\ngir1.2-flatpak-1.0 - 1.0.1-0ubuntu0.1\nlibflatpak0 - 1.0.1-0ubuntu0.1\nNo subscription required",
