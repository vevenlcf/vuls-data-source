Due to incorrect input validation, there is a heap-based buffer overflow that can result in Denial of Service to all clients using the proxy. Severity is high due to this vulnerability occurring before normal security checks; any remote client that can reach the proxy port can trivially perform the attack via a crafted URI scheme.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2019-18676` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nsquid - 3.5.27-1ubuntu1.7\nsquid-cgi - 3.5.27-1ubuntu1.7\nsquid-common - 3.5.27-1ubuntu1.7\nsquid-purge - 3.5.27-1ubuntu1.7\nsquid3 - 3.5.27-1ubuntu1.7\nsquidclient - 3.5.27-1ubuntu1.7\nNo subscription required",
