  "title": "CVE-2019-3857 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium.",
  "description": "An integer overflow flaw which could lead to an out of bounds write was discovered in libssh2 before 1.8.1 in the way SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_REQUEST packets with an exit signal are parsed. A remote attacker who compromises a SSH server may be able to execute code on the client system when a user connects to the server. It was discovered that libssh2 incorrectly handled SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_REQUEST packets. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary code.",
