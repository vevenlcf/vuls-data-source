  "description": "The \"Forget about this site\" feature in the History pane is intended to remove all saved user data that indicates a user has visited a site. This includes removing any HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) settings received from sites that use it. Due to a bug, sites on the pre-load list also have their HSTS setting removed. On the next visit to that site if the user specifies an http: URL rather than secure https: they will not be protected by the pre-loaded HSTS setting. After that visit the site's HSTS setting will be restored. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 69 and Firefox ESR \u003c 68.1.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2019-11747` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nfirefox - 69.0+build2-0ubuntu0.18.04.1\nfirefox-geckodriver - 69.0+build2-0ubuntu0.18.04.1\nfirefox-mozsymbols - 69.0+build2-0ubuntu0.18.04.1\nNo subscription required",
