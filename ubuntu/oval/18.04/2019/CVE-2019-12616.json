  "title": "CVE-2019-12616 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium.",
  "description": "An issue was discovered in phpMyAdmin before 4.9.0. A vulnerability was found that allows an attacker to trigger a CSRF attack against a phpMyAdmin user. The attacker can trick the user, for instance through a broken \u003cimg\u003e tag pointing at the victim's phpMyAdmin database, and the attacker can potentially deliver a payload (such as a specific INSERT or DELETE statement) to the victim. It was discovered that phpMyAdmin incorrectly handled some requests. An attacker could possibly use this to perform a CSRF attack.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2019-12616` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nphpmyadmin - 4:4.6.6-5ubuntu0.5\nNo subscription required",
