  "title": "CVE-2019-6250 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium.",
  "description": "A pointer overflow, with code execution, was discovered in ZeroMQ libzmq (aka 0MQ) 4.2.x and 4.3.x before 4.3.1. A v2_decoder.cpp zmq::v2_decoder_t::size_ready integer overflow allows an authenticated attacker to overwrite an arbitrary amount of bytes beyond the bounds of a buffer, which can be leveraged to run arbitrary code on the target system. The memory layout allows the attacker to inject OS commands into a data structure located immediately after the problematic buffer (i.e., it is not necessary to use a typical buffer-overflow exploitation technique that changes the flow of control).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2019-6250` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibzmq5 - 4.2.5-1ubuntu0.1\nNo subscription required",
