  "title": "CVE-2019-5736 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium.",
  "description": "runc through 1.0-rc6, as used in Docker before 18.09.2 and other products, allows attackers to overwrite the host runc binary (and consequently obtain host root access) by leveraging the ability to execute a command as root within one of these types of containers: (1) a new container with an attacker-controlled image, or (2) an existing container, to which the attacker previously had write access, that can be attached with docker exec. This occurs because of file-descriptor mishandling, related to /proc/self/exe.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2019-5736` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ndocker.io - 18.06.1-0ubuntu1.2~18.04.1\nNo subscription required\n\nrunc - 1.0.0~rc4+dfsg1-6ubuntu0.18.04.1\nNo subscription required",
