  "description": "Django before 1.11.27, 2.x before 2.2.9, and 3.x before 3.0.1 allows account takeover. A suitably crafted email address (that is equal to an existing user's email address after case transformation of Unicode characters) would allow an attacker to be sent a password reset token for the matched user account. (One mitigation in the new releases is to send password reset tokens only to the registered user email address.)\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2019-19844` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\npython-django - 1:1.11.11-1ubuntu1.6\npython-django-common - 1:1.11.11-1ubuntu1.6\npython3-django - 1:1.11.11-1ubuntu1.6\nNo subscription required",
