  "title": "CVE-2019-16275 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium.",
  "description": "hostapd before 2.10 and wpa_supplicant before 2.10 allow an incorrect indication of disconnection in certain situations because source address validation is mishandled. This is a denial of service that should have been prevented by PMF (aka management frame protection). The attacker must send a crafted 802.11 frame from a location that is within the 802.11 communications range. An attacker in radio range of the access point could inject a specially constructed unauthenticated IEEE 802.11 frame to the access point to cause associated stations to be disconnected and require a reconnection to the network.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2019-16275` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nhostapd - 2:2.6-15ubuntu2.5\nwpagui - 2:2.6-15ubuntu2.5\nwpasupplicant - 2:2.6-15ubuntu2.5\nNo subscription required",
