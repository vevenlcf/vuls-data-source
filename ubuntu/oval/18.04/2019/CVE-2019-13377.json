  "description": "The implementations of SAE and EAP-pwd in hostapd and wpa_supplicant 2.x through 2.8 are vulnerable to side-channel attacks as a result of observable timing differences and cache access patterns when Brainpool curves are used.

The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nhostapd - 2:2.6-15ubuntu2.4\nwpagui - 2:2.6-15ubuntu2.4\nwpasupplicant - 2:2.6-15ubuntu2.4\nNo subscription required",
