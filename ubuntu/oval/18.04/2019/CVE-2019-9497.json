  "title": "CVE-2019-9497 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium.",
  "description": "The implementations of EAP-PWD in hostapd EAP Server and wpa_supplicant EAP Peer do not validate the scalar and element values in EAP-pwd-Commit. This vulnerability may allow an attacker to complete EAP-PWD authentication without knowing the password. However, unless the crypto library does not implement additional checks for the EC point, the attacker will not be able to derive the session key or complete the key exchange. Both hostapd with SAE support and wpa_supplicant with SAE support prior to and including version 2.4 are affected. Both hostapd with EAP-pwd support and wpa_supplicant with EAP-pwd support prior to and including version 2.7 are affected.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2019-9497` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nhostapd - 2:2.6-15ubuntu2.2\nwpagui - 2:2.6-15ubuntu2.2\nwpasupplicant - 2:2.6-15ubuntu2.2\nNo subscription required",
