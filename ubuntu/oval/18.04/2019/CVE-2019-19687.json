  "title": "CVE-2019-19687 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium.",
  "description": "OpenStack Keystone 15.0.0 and 16.0.0 is affected by Data Leakage in the list credentials API. Any user with a role on a project is able to list any credentials with the /v3/credentials API when enforce_scope is false. Users with a role on a project are able to view any other users' credentials, which could (for example) leak sign-on information for Time-based One Time Passwords (TOTP). Deployments with enforce_scope set to false are affected. (There will be a slight performance impact for the list credentials API once this issue is fixed.)\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2019-19687` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nkeystone - 2:13.0.2-0ubuntu1\npython-keystone - 2:13.0.2-0ubuntu1\nNo subscription required",
