  "title": "CVE-2019-13509 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - low.",
  "description": "In Docker CE and EE before 18.09.8 (as well as Docker EE before 17.06.2-ee-23 and 18.x before 18.03.1-ee-10), Docker Engine in debug mode may sometimes add secrets to the debug log. This applies to a scenario where docker stack deploy is run to redeploy a stack that includes (non external) secrets. It potentially applies to other API users of the stack API if they resend the secret.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2019-13509` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ndocker.io - 18.09.7-0ubuntu1\nNo subscription required",
