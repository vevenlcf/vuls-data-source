  "title": "CVE-2019-6256 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium.",
  "description": "A Denial of Service issue was discovered in the LIVE555 Streaming Media libraries as used in Live555 Media Server 0.93. It can cause an RTSPServer crash in handleHTTPCmd_TunnelingPOST, when RTSP-over-HTTP tunneling is supported, via x-sessioncookie HTTP headers in a GET request and a POST request within the same TCP session. This occurs because of a call to an incorrect virtual function pointer in the readSocket function in GroupsockHelper.cpp. It was discovered that liveMedia incorrectly handled certain network sessions. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service.",
