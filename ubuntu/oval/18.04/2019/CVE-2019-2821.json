  "title": "CVE-2019-2821 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - low.",
  "description": "Vulnerability in the Java SE component of Oracle Java SE (subcomponent: JSSE). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 11.0.3 and 12.0.1. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via TLS to compromise Java SE. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized access to critical data or complete access to all Java SE accessible data. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets (in Java SE 8), that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an administrator). CVSS 3.0 Base Score 5.3 (Confidentiality impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N). It was discovered that the Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE) component in OpenJDK did not properly handle OCSP stapling messages during TLS handshake in some situations. An attacker could use this to expose sensitive information.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2019-2821` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nopenjdk-11-demo - 11.0.4+11-1ubuntu2~18.04.3\nopenjdk-11-jdk - 11.0.4+11-1ubuntu2~18.04.3\nopenjdk-11-jdk-headless - 11.0.4+11-1ubuntu2~18.04.3\nopenjdk-11-jre - 11.0.4+11-1ubuntu2~18.04.3\nopenjdk-11-jre-headless - 11.0.4+11-1ubuntu2~18.04.3\nopenjdk-11-jre-zero - 11.0.4+11-1ubuntu2~18.04.3\nopenjdk-11-source - 11.0.4+11-1ubuntu2~18.04.3\nNo subscription required",
