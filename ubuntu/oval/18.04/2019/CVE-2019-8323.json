  "title": "CVE-2019-8323 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium.",
  "description": "An issue was discovered in RubyGems 2.6 and later through 3.0.2. Gem::GemcutterUtilities#with_response may output the API response to stdout as it is. Therefore, if the API side modifies the response, escape sequence injection may occur. It was discovered that Gem::GemcutterUtilities#with_response failed to escape certain characters. An attacker could use this vulnerability inject escape sequences into a victim's terminal.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2019-8323` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibruby2.5 - 2.5.1-1ubuntu1.2\nruby2.5 - 2.5.1-1ubuntu1.2\nNo subscription required",
