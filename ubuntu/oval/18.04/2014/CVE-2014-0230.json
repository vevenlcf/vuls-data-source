  "title": "CVE-2014-0230 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - low.",
  "description": "Apache Tomcat 6.x before 6.0.44, 7.x before 7.0.55, and 8.x before 8.0.9 does not properly handle cases where an HTTP response occurs before finishing the reading of an entire request body, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (thread consumption) via a series of aborted upload attempts. It was discovered that Tomcat incorrectly handled HTTP responses occurring before the entire request body was finished being read. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a limited denial of service.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2014-0230` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibservlet3.0-java - 7.0.56-2\nNo subscription required\n\nlibtomcat8-embed-java - 8.0.14-1\nlibtomcat8-java - 8.0.14-1\ntomcat8 - 8.0.14-1\ntomcat8-admin - 8.0.14-1\ntomcat8-common - 8.0.14-1\ntomcat8-examples - 8.0.14-1\ntomcat8-user - 8.0.14-1\nNo subscription required",
  "note": "mdeslaur\u003e ASF says this is a low severity issue that, unlike the original description, can't cause memory consumption, only a limited denial of service. http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/tomcat-announce/201505.mbox/%3C554949D1.8030904%40apache.org%3E",
