  "title": "CVE-2018-14636 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - low.",
  "description": "Live-migrated instances are briefly able to inspect traffic for other instances on the same hypervisor. This brief window could be extended indefinitely if the instance's port is set administratively down prior to live-migration and kept down after the migration is complete. This is possible due to the Open vSwitch integration bridge being connected to the instance during migration. When connected to the integration bridge, all traffic for instances using the same Open vSwitch instance would potentially be visible to the migrated guest, as the required Open vSwitch VLAN filters are only applied post-migration. Versions of openstack-neutron before 13.0.0.0b2, 12.0.3, 11.0.5 are vulnerable.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2018-14636` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nneutron-common - 2:12.0.3-0ubuntu1\nneutron-dhcp-agent - 2:12.0.3-0ubuntu1\nneutron-l3-agent - 2:12.0.3-0ubuntu1\nneutron-linuxbridge-agent - 2:12.0.3-0ubuntu1\nneutron-macvtap-agent - 2:12.0.3-0ubuntu1\nneutron-metadata-agent - 2:12.0.3-0ubuntu1\nneutron-metering-agent - 2:12.0.3-0ubuntu1\nneutron-openvswitch-agent - 2:12.0.3-0ubuntu1\nneutron-plugin-linuxbridge-agent - 2:12.0.3-0ubuntu1\nneutron-plugin-ml2 - 2:12.0.3-0ubuntu1\nneutron-plugin-openvswitch-agent - 2:12.0.3-0ubuntu1\nneutron-plugin-sriov-agent - 2:12.0.3-0ubuntu1\nneutron-server - 2:12.0.3-0ubuntu1\nneutron-sriov-agent - 2:12.0.3-0ubuntu1\npython-neutron - 2:12.0.3-0ubuntu1\nNo subscription required",
