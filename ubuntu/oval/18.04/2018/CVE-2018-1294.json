  "title": "CVE-2018-1294 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - untriaged.",
  "description": "If a user of Apache Commons Email (typically an application programmer) passes unvalidated input as the so-called \"Bounce Address\", and that input contains line-breaks, then the email details (recipients, contents, etc.) might be manipulated. Mitigation: Users should upgrade to Commons-Email 1.5. You can mitigate this vulnerability for older versions of Commons Email by stripping line-breaks from data, that will be passed to Email.setBounceAddress(String).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2018-1294` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibcommons-email-java - 1.5-1\nNo subscription required",
