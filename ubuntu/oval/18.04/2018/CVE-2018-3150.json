  "description": "Vulnerability in the Java SE component of Oracle Java SE (subcomponent: Utility). The supported version that is affected is Java SE: 11. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Java SE accessible data. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an administrator). CVSS 3.0 Base Score 3.7 (Integrity impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N). It was discovered that the Utility component of OpenJDK did not properly ensure all attributes in a JAR were signed before use. An attacker could use this to specially construct an untrusted Java application or applet that could escape sandbox restrictions\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2018-3150` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nopenjdk-11-demo - 10.0.2+13-1ubuntu0.18.04.3\nopenjdk-11-jdk - 10.0.2+13-1ubuntu0.18.04.3\nopenjdk-11-jdk-headless - 10.0.2+13-1ubuntu0.18.04.3\nopenjdk-11-jre - 10.0.2+13-1ubuntu0.18.04.3\nopenjdk-11-jre-headless - 10.0.2+13-1ubuntu0.18.04.3\nopenjdk-11-jre-zero - 10.0.2+13-1ubuntu0.18.04.3\nopenjdk-11-source - 10.0.2+13-1ubuntu0.18.04.3\nNo subscription required",
