  "title": "CVE-2018-12123 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - low.",
  "description": "Node.js: All versions prior to Node.js 6.15.0, 8.14.0, 10.14.0 and 11.3.0: Hostname spoofing in URL parser for javascript protocol: If a Node.js application is using url.parse() to determine the URL hostname, that hostname can be spoofed by using a mixed case \"javascript:\" (e.g. \"javAscript:\") protocol (other protocols are not affected). If security decisions are made about the URL based on the hostname, they may be incorrect. Martin Bajanik discovered that the url.parse() method would return incorrect results if it received specially crafted input. An attacker could use this vulnerability to spoof the hostname and bypass hostname-specific security controls.",
