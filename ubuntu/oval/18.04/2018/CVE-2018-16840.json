  "description": "A heap use-after-free flaw was found in curl versions from 7.59.0 through 7.61.1 in the code related to closing an easy handle. When closing and cleaning up an 'easy' handle in the `Curl_close()` function, the library code first frees a struct (without nulling the pointer) and might then subsequently erroneously write to a struct field within that already freed struct.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2018-16840` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ncurl - 7.58.0-2ubuntu3.3\nlibcurl3-gnutls - 7.58.0-2ubuntu3.3\nlibcurl3-nss - 7.58.0-2ubuntu3.3\nlibcurl4 - 7.58.0-2ubuntu3.3\nNo subscription required",
