  "title": "CVE-2018-16874 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium.",
  "description": "In Go before 1.10.6 and 1.11.x before 1.11.3, the \"go get\" command is vulnerable to directory traversal when executed with the import path of a malicious Go package which contains curly braces (both '{' and '}' characters). Specifically, it is only vulnerable in GOPATH mode, but not in module mode (the distinction is documented at https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Module_aware_go_get). The attacker can cause an arbitrary filesystem write, which can lead to code execution.",
  "note": "mdeslaur\u003e Packages built using golang need to be rebuilt once the vulnerability has been fixed. This CVE entry does not list packages that need rebuilding outside of the main repository or the Ubuntu variants with PPA overlays.",
