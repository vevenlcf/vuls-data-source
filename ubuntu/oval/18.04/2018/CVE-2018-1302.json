  "title": "CVE-2018-1302 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - low.",
  "description": "When an HTTP/2 stream was destroyed after being handled, the Apache HTTP Server prior to version 2.4.30 could have written a NULL pointer potentially to an already freed memory. The memory pools maintained by the server make this vulnerability hard to trigger in usual configurations, the reporter and the team could not reproduce it outside debug builds, so it is classified as low risk.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2018-1302` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\napache2 - 2.4.29-1ubuntu4.4\napache2-bin - 2.4.29-1ubuntu4.4\napache2-data - 2.4.29-1ubuntu4.4\napache2-suexec-custom - 2.4.29-1ubuntu4.4\napache2-suexec-pristine - 2.4.29-1ubuntu4.4\napache2-utils - 2.4.29-1ubuntu4.4\nNo subscription required",
  "note": "mdeslaur\u003e artful and older don't enable http2 in the build. this needs to be fixed by backporting the whole http2 module from a more-recent apache2",
