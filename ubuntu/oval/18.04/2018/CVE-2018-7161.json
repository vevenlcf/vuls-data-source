  "title": "CVE-2018-7161 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium.",
  "description": "All versions of Node.js 8.x, 9.x, and 10.x are vulnerable and the severity is HIGH. An attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS) by causing a node server providing an http2 server to crash. This can be accomplished by interacting with the http2 server in a manner that triggers a cleanup bug where objects are used in native code after they are no longer available. This has been addressed by updating the http2 implementation.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2018-7161` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nnodejs - 8.10.0~dfsg-2ubuntu0.2\nNo subscription required",
