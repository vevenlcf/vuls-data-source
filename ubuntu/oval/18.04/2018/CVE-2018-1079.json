  "description": "pcs before version 0.9.164 and 0.10 is vulnerable to a privilege escalation via authorized user malicious REST call. The REST interface of the pcsd service did not properly sanitize the file name from the /remote/put_file query.

The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\npcs - 0.9.164-1\nNo subscription required",
