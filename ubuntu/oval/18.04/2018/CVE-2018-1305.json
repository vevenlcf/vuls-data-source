  "title": "CVE-2018-1305 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium.",
  "description": "Security constraints defined by annotations of Servlets in Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.4, 8.5.0 to 8.5.27, 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.49 and 7.0.0 to 7.0.84 were only applied once a Servlet had been loaded. Because security constraints defined in this way apply to the URL pattern and any URLs below that point, it was possible - depending on the order Servlets were loaded - for some security constraints not to be applied. This could have exposed resources to users who were not authorised to access them.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2018-1305` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibtomcat8-embed-java - 8.5.30-1ubuntu1\nlibtomcat8-java - 8.5.30-1ubuntu1\ntomcat8 - 8.5.30-1ubuntu1\ntomcat8-admin - 8.5.30-1ubuntu1\ntomcat8-common - 8.5.30-1ubuntu1\ntomcat8-examples - 8.5.30-1ubuntu1\ntomcat8-user - 8.5.30-1ubuntu1\nNo subscription required",
