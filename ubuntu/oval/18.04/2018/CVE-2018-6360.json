  "title": "CVE-2018-6360 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium.",
  "description": "mpv through 0.28.0 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted web site, because it reads HTML documents containing VIDEO elements, and accepts arbitrary URLs in a src attribute without a protocol whitelist in player/lua/ytdl_hook.lua. For example, an av://lavfi:ladspa=file= URL signifies that the product should call dlopen on a shared object file located at an arbitrary local pathname. The issue exists because the product does not consider that youtube-dl can provide a potentially unsafe URL.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2018-6360` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibmpv1 - 0.27.2-1ubuntu1\nmpv - 0.27.2-1ubuntu1\nNo subscription required",
