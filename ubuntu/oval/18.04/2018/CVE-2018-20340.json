  "description": "Yubico libu2f-host 1.1.6 contains unchecked buffers in devs.c, which could enable a malicious token to exploit a buffer overflow. An attacker could use this to attempt to execute malicious code using a crafted USB device masquerading as a security token on a computer where the affected library is currently in use. It is not possible to perform this attack with a genuine YubiKey.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2018-20340` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibu2f-host0 - 1.1.4-1ubuntu0.1\nlibu2f-udev - 1.1.4-1ubuntu0.1\nu2f-host - 1.1.4-1ubuntu0.1\nNo subscription required",
