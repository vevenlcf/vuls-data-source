  "description": "soundlib/Snd_fx.cpp in OpenMPT before 1.27.07.00 and libopenmpt before 0.3.8 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) via an IT or MO3 file with many nested pattern loops. It was discovered that OpenMPT incorrectly handled certain failes. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service.",
