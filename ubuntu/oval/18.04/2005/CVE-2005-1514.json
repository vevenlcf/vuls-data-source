  "title": "CVE-2005-1514 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium.",
  "description": "commands.c in qmail, when running on 64 bit platforms with a large amount of virtual memory, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code via a long SMTP command without a space character, which causes an array to be referenced with a negative index. It was discovered that netqmail did not properly handle certain input. Both remote and local attackers could use this vulnerability to cause netqmail to crash or execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2005-1514` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nqmail - 1.06-6.2~deb10u1build0.18.04.1\nqmail-uids-gids - 1.06-6.2~deb10u1build0.18.04.1\nNo subscription required",
