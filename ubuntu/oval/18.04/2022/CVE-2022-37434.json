  "title": "CVE-2022-37434 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium.",
  "description": "zlib through 1.2.12 has a heap-based buffer over-read or buffer overflow in inflate in inflate.c via a large gzip header extra field. NOTE: only applications that call inflateGetHeader are affected. Some common applications bundle the affected zlib source code but may be unable to call inflateGetHeader (e.g., see the nodejs/node reference).",
  "note": "mdeslaur\u003e Since 3.1.3-7, rsync builds with the system zlib. Apps are only vulnerable if they use inflateGetHeader() and call inflate() in a loop. This fix caused a regression, see: https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/08/09/1 https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/9271 The second commit below fixes the regression.",
