  "description": "Git for Windows is a fork of Git containing Windows-specific patches. This vulnerability affects users working on multi-user machines, where untrusted parties have write access to the same hard disk. Those untrusted parties could create the folder `C:\\.git`, which would be picked up by Git operations run supposedly outside a repository while searching for a Git directory. Git would then respect any config in said Git directory. Git Bash users who set `GIT_PS1_SHOWDIRTYSTATE` are vulnerable as well. Users who installed posh-gitare vulnerable simply by starting a PowerShell. Users of IDEs such as Visual Studio are vulnerable: simply creating a new project would already read and respect the config specified in `C:\\.git\\config`. Users of the Microsoft fork of Git are vulnerable simply by starting a Git Bash. The problem has been patched in Git for Windows v2.35.2. Users unable to upgrade may create the folder `.git` on all drives where Git commands are run, and remove read/write access from those folders as a workaround. Alternatively, define or extend `GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES` to cover the _parent_ directory of the user profile, e.g. `C:\\Users` if the user profile is located in `C:\\Users\\my-user-name`.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2022-24765` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ngit - 1:2.17.1-1ubuntu0.11\ngit-all - 1:2.17.1-1ubuntu0.11\ngit-cvs - 1:2.17.1-1ubuntu0.11\ngit-daemon-run - 1:2.17.1-1ubuntu0.11\ngit-daemon-sysvinit - 1:2.17.1-1ubuntu0.11\ngit-el - 1:2.17.1-1ubuntu0.11\ngit-email - 1:2.17.1-1ubuntu0.11\ngit-gui - 1:2.17.1-1ubuntu0.11\ngit-man - 1:2.17.1-1ubuntu0.11\ngit-mediawiki - 1:2.17.1-1ubuntu0.11\ngit-svn - 1:2.17.1-1ubuntu0.11\ngitk - 1:2.17.1-1ubuntu0.11\ngitweb - 1:2.17.1-1ubuntu0.11\nNo subscription required",
