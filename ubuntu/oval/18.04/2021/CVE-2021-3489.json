  "title": "CVE-2021-3489 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - high.",
  "description": "The eBPF RINGBUF bpf_ringbuf_reserve() function in the Linux kernel did not check that the allocated size was smaller than the ringbuf size, allowing an attacker to perform out-of-bounds writes within the kernel and therefore, arbitrary code execution. This issue was fixed via commit 4b81ccebaeee (\"bpf, ringbuf: Deny reserve of buffers larger than ringbuf\") (v5.13-rc4) and backported to the stable kernels in v5.12.4, v5.11.21, and v5.10.37. It was introduced via 457f44363a88 (\"bpf: Implement BPF ring buffer and verifier support for it\") (v5.8-rc1). Ryota Shiga discovered that the eBPF implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly verify that a BPF program only reserved as much memory for a ring buffer as was allocated. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2021-3489` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlinux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-1018-ibm - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.2\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-ibm - 5.4.0.1010\nlinux-image-ibm-edge - 5.4.0.1010\nNo subscription required\n\nlinux-image-5.4.0-1018-ibm - 5.4.0-1010.11~18.04.2\nNo subscription required",
