  "description": "In NTFS-3G versions \u003c 2021.8.22, when a specially crafted NTFS attribute is supplied to the function ntfs_get_attribute_value, a heap buffer overflow can occur allowing for memory disclosure or denial of service. The vulnerability is caused by an out-of-bound buffer access which can be triggered by mounting a crafted ntfs partition. The root cause is a missing consistency check after reading an MFT record : the \"bytes_in_use\" field should be less than the \"bytes_allocated\" field. When it is not, the parsing of the records proceeds into the wild.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2021-33285` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibntfs-3g88 - 1:2017.3.23-2ubuntu0.18.04.3\nntfs-3g - 1:2017.3.23-2ubuntu0.18.04.3\nNo subscription required",
