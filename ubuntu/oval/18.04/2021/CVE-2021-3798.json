  "title": "CVE-2021-3798 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium.",
  "description": "A flaw was found in openCryptoki. The openCryptoki Soft token does not check if an EC key is valid when an EC key is created via C_CreateObject, nor when C_DeriveKey is used with ECDH public data. This may allow a malicious user to extract the private key by performing an invalid curve attack.",
