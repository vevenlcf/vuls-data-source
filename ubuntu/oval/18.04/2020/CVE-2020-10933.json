  "title": "CVE-2020-10933 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - low.",
  "description": "An issue was discovered in Ruby 2.5.x through 2.5.7, 2.6.x through 2.6.5, and 2.7.0. If a victim calls BasicSocket#read_nonblock(requested_size, buffer, exception: false), the method resizes the buffer to fit the requested size, but no data is copied. Thus, the buffer string provides the previous value of the heap. This may expose possibly sensitive data from the interpreter.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2020-10933` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibruby2.5 - 2.5.1-1ubuntu1.8\nruby2.5 - 2.5.1-1ubuntu1.8\nNo subscription required",
