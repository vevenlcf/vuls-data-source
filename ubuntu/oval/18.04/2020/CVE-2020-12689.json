  "title": "CVE-2020-12689 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium.",
  "description": "An issue was discovered in OpenStack Keystone before 15.0.1, and 16.0.0. Any user authenticated within a limited scope (trust/oauth/application credential) can create an EC2 credential with an escalated permission, such as obtaining admin while the user is on a limited viewer role. This potentially allows a malicious user to act as the admin on a project another user has the admin role on, which can effectively grant that user global admin privileges.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2020-12689` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nkeystone - 2:13.0.4-0ubuntu1\npython-keystone - 2:13.0.4-0ubuntu1\nNo subscription required",
