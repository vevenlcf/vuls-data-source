  "description": "reel through 0.6.1 allows Request Smuggling attacks due to incorrect Content-Length and Transfer encoding header parsing. It is possible to conduct HTTP request smuggling attacks by sending the Content-Length header twice. Furthermore, invalid Transfer Encoding headers were found to be parsed as valid which could be leveraged for TE:CL smuggling attacks. Note: This project is deprecated, and is not maintained any more.",
