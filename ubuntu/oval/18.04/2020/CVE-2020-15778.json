  "description": "** DISPUTED ** scp in OpenSSH through 8.3p1 allows command injection in the scp.c toremote function, as demonstrated by backtick characters in the destination argument. NOTE: the vendor reportedly has stated that they intentionally omit validation of \"anomalous argument transfers\" because that could \"stand a great chance of breaking existing workflows.\"",
  "note": "seth-arnold\u003e openssh-ssh1 is provided for compatibility with old devices that cannot be upgraded to modern protocols. Thus we may not provide security support for this package if doing so would prevent access to equipment. mdeslaur\u003e the upstream OpenSSH project will not be fixing this issue as it may result in breaking existing workflows. As such, we will not be fixing this issue in Ubuntu.",
