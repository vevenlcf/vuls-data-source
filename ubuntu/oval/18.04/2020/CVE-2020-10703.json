  "title": "CVE-2020-10703 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - low.",
  "description": "A NULL pointer dereference was found in the libvirt API responsible introduced in upstream version 3.10.0, and fixed in libvirt 6.0.0, for fetching a storage pool based on its target path. In more detail, this flaw affects storage pools created without a target path such as network-based pools like gluster and RBD. Unprivileged users with a read-only connection could abuse this flaw to crash the libvirt daemon, resulting in a potential denial of service.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2020-10703` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibnss-libvirt - 4.0.0-1ubuntu8.17\nlibvirt-bin - 4.0.0-1ubuntu8.17\nlibvirt-clients - 4.0.0-1ubuntu8.17\nlibvirt-daemon - 4.0.0-1ubuntu8.17\nlibvirt-daemon-driver-storage-gluster - 4.0.0-1ubuntu8.17\nlibvirt-daemon-driver-storage-rbd - 4.0.0-1ubuntu8.17\nlibvirt-daemon-driver-storage-sheepdog - 4.0.0-1ubuntu8.17\nlibvirt-daemon-driver-storage-zfs - 4.0.0-1ubuntu8.17\nlibvirt-daemon-system - 4.0.0-1ubuntu8.17\nlibvirt-sanlock - 4.0.0-1ubuntu8.17\nlibvirt-wireshark - 4.0.0-1ubuntu8.17\nlibvirt0 - 4.0.0-1ubuntu8.17\nNo subscription required",
