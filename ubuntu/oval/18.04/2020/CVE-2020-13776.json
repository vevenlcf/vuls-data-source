  "title": "CVE-2020-13776 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - low.",
  "description": "systemd through v245 mishandles numerical usernames such as ones composed of decimal digits or 0x followed by hex digits, as demonstrated by use of root privileges when privileges of the 0x0 user account were intended. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2017-1000082.",
  "note": "mdeslaur\u003e The administrator would have to create a systemd service unit with a numerical username or a username starting with 0x as a User= value, and that particular userid would need to exist on the system. Setting priority to low due to this unlikely scenario.  Fixing this requires an extensive backport that refactors integer parsing in systemd and the risk of regressions stemming from the behavioural change outweighs the severity of this issue. We will not be fixing this issue in stable Ubuntu releases.",
