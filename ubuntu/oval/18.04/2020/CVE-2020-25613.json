  "title": "CVE-2020-25613 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - low.",
  "description": "An issue was discovered in Ruby through 2.5.8, 2.6.x through 2.6.6, and 2.7.x through 2.7.1. WEBrick, a simple HTTP server bundled with Ruby, had not checked the transfer-encoding header value rigorously. An attacker may potentially exploit this issue to bypass a reverse proxy (which also has a poor header check), which may lead to an HTTP Request Smuggling attack.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2020-25613` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibruby2.5 - 2.5.1-1ubuntu1.8\nruby2.5 - 2.5.1-1ubuntu1.8\nNo subscription required",
