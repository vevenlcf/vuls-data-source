  "title": "CVE-2020-27749 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium.",
  "description": "A flaw was found in grub2 in versions prior to 2.06. Variable names present are expanded in the supplied command line into their corresponding variable contents, using a 1kB stack buffer for temporary storage, without sufficient bounds checking. If the function is called with a command line that references a variable with a sufficiently large payload, it is possible to overflow the stack buffer, corrupt the stack frame and control execution which could also circumvent Secure Boot protections. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability. Chris Coulson discovered that a buffer overflow existed in the command line parser in GRUB 2. A local attacker could use this to execute arbitrary code and bypass UEFI Secure Boot restrictions.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2020-27749` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ngrub-efi-amd64-signed - 1.167~18.04.5\ngrub-efi-arm64-signed - 1.167~18.04.5\nNo subscription required\n\ngrub-efi-amd64 - 2.04-1ubuntu44.1.2\ngrub-efi-amd64-bin - 2.04-1ubuntu44.1.2\ngrub-efi-arm64 - 2.04-1ubuntu44.1.2\ngrub-efi-arm64-bin - 2.04-1ubuntu44.1.2\nNo subscription required",
