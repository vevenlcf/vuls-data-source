  "description": "An issue was discovered in OpenStack Keystone before 15.0.1, and 16.0.0. Any authenticated user can create an EC2 credential for themselves for a project that they have a specified role on, and then perform an update to the credential user and project, allowing them to masquerade as another user. This potentially allows a malicious user to act as the admin on a project another user has the admin role on, which can effectively grant that user global admin privileges.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2020-12691` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nkeystone - 2:13.0.4-0ubuntu1\npython-keystone - 2:13.0.4-0ubuntu1\nNo subscription required",
