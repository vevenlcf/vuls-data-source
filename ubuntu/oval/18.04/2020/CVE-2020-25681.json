  "title": "CVE-2020-25681 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium.",
  "description": "A flaw was found in dnsmasq before version 2.83. A heap-based buffer overflow was discovered in the way RRSets are sorted before validating with DNSSEC data. An attacker on the network, who can forge DNS replies such as that they are accepted as valid, could use this flaw to cause a buffer overflow with arbitrary data in a heap memory segment, possibly executing code on the machine. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2020-25681` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ndnsmasq - 2.79-1ubuntu0.2\ndnsmasq-base - 2.79-1ubuntu0.2\ndnsmasq-base-lua - 2.79-1ubuntu0.2\ndnsmasq-utils - 2.79-1ubuntu0.2\nNo subscription required",
