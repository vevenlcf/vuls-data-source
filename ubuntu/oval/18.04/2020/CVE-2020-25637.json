  "title": "CVE-2020-25637 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - negligible.",
  "description": "A double free memory issue was found to occur in the libvirt API, in versions before 6.8.0, responsible for requesting information about network interfaces of a running QEMU domain. This flaw affects the polkit access control driver. Specifically, clients connecting to the read-write socket with limited ACL permissions could use this flaw to crash the libvirt daemon, resulting in a denial of service, or potentially escalate their privileges on the system. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2020-25637` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibnss-libvirt - 4.0.0-1ubuntu8.21\nlibvirt-bin - 4.0.0-1ubuntu8.21\nlibvirt-clients - 4.0.0-1ubuntu8.21\nlibvirt-daemon - 4.0.0-1ubuntu8.21\nlibvirt-daemon-driver-storage-gluster - 4.0.0-1ubuntu8.21\nlibvirt-daemon-driver-storage-rbd - 4.0.0-1ubuntu8.21\nlibvirt-daemon-driver-storage-sheepdog - 4.0.0-1ubuntu8.21\nlibvirt-daemon-driver-storage-zfs - 4.0.0-1ubuntu8.21\nlibvirt-daemon-system - 4.0.0-1ubuntu8.21\nlibvirt-sanlock - 4.0.0-1ubuntu8.21\nlibvirt-wireshark - 4.0.0-1ubuntu8.21\nlibvirt0 - 4.0.0-1ubuntu8.21\nNo subscription required",
  "note": "mdeslaur\u003e Read-only clients can't exploit this flaw. Clients connecting to the read-write socket can exploit this to crash libvirt or possibly execute code, but on Ubuntu, access to the read-write socket already grants root-equivalent permissions, so this flaw has limited impact. Setting priority to negligible.",
