  "title": "CVE-2015-0204 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - low.",
  "description": "The ssl3_get_key_exchange function in s3_clnt.c in OpenSSL before 0.9.8zd, 1.0.0 before 1.0.0p, and 1.0.1 before 1.0.1k allows remote SSL servers to conduct RSA-to-EXPORT_RSA downgrade attacks and facilitate brute-force decryption by offering a weak ephemeral RSA key in a noncompliant role, related to the \"FREAK\" issue.  NOTE: the scope of this CVE is only client code based on OpenSSL, not EXPORT_RSA issues associated with servers or other TLS implementations.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2015-0204` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibssl1.1 - 1.0.1f-1ubuntu10\nopenssl - 1.0.1f-1ubuntu10\nNo subscription required",
