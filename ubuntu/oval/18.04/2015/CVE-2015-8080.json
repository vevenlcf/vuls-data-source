  "title": "CVE-2015-8080 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium.",
  "description": "Integer overflow in the getnum function in lua_struct.c in Redis 2.8.x before 2.8.24 and 3.0.x before 3.0.6 allows context-dependent attackers with permission to run Lua code in a Redis session to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and application crash) or possibly bypass intended sandbox restrictions via a large number, which triggers a stack-based buffer overflow. It was discovered that Redis incorrectly handled large number inputs. An attacker could possibly use this issue to case a denial of service or bypass sandbox restrictions.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2015-8080` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nredis - 5:4.0.9-1\nredis-sentinel - 5:4.0.9-1\nredis-server - 5:4.0.9-1\nredis-tools - 5:4.0.9-1\nNo subscription required",
