  "note": "seth-arnold\u003e since the message parsing limit defaults to 64 megabytes a software author would have to change the limit in order to handle larger messages anyway, and is thus unlikely to generate these messages in the short-term. (There is no actual limit on generation, so this might be an issue today -- it is just not a priority for the maintainer.) mdeslaur\u003e per upstream bug, this was fixed in 3.4.0",
