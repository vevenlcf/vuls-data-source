  "title": "CVE-2016-10728 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium.",
  "description": "An issue was discovered in Suricata before 3.1.2. If an ICMPv4 error packet is received as the first packet on a flow in the to_client direction, it confuses the rule grouping lookup logic. The toclient inspection will then continue with the wrong rule group. This can lead to missed detection.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2016-10728` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibhtp-0.5.23-1 - 3.2-2ubuntu3\nsuricata - 3.2-2ubuntu3\nsuricata-hyperscan - 3.2-2ubuntu3\nsuricata-oinkmaster - 3.2-2ubuntu3\nNo subscription required",
