  "title": "CVE-2016-8860 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) - medium.",
  "description": "Tor before 0.2.8.9 and 0.2.9.x before 0.2.9.4-alpha had internal functions that were entitled to expect that buf_t data had NUL termination, but the implementation of or/buffers.c did not ensure that NUL termination was present, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (client, hidden service, relay, or authority crash) via crafted data. It was discovered that Tor improperly NUL terminated data. An attacker could possibly use this to cause a crash and denial of service.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2016-8860` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ntor - 0.2.8.9-1ubuntu1\ntor-geoipdb - 0.2.8.9-1ubuntu1\nNo subscription required",
