  "description": "An issue was discovered in xrdp before 0.9.1. When successfully logging in using RDP into an xrdp session, the file ~/.vnc/sesman_${username}_passwd is created. Its content is the equivalent of the user's cleartext password, DES encrypted with a known key. It was discovered that xrdp used a known key to store session passwords in text files. An attacker could potentially decrypt the file to obtain a user password.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2013-1430` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nxorgxrdp - 0.9.1~2016121126+git5171fa7-1\nxrdp - 0.9.1~2016121126+git5171fa7-1\nxrdp-pulseaudio-installer - 0.9.1~2016121126+git5171fa7-1\nNo subscription required",
