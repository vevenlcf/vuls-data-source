  "description": "res_query in libresolv in glibc before 2.25 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and process crash). Florian Weimer discovered a NULL pointer dereference in the DNS resolver of the GNU C Library. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service.",
  "note": "tyhicks\u003e See test case in the bug tyhicks\u003e no fix upstream as of 2016-09-09 sbeattie\u003e patch committed upstream on 2016-12-31; renames symbol so backporting may not be easy. sbeattie\u003e commit included in glibc 2.25 release sbeattie\u003e debian fixed this in unstable in 2.24-9 sbeattie\u003e fixing this does indeed break the internal ABI between libnss_dns and libresolv. We're backing out this change. sbeattie\u003e reverted from zesty in 2.24-9ubuntu2 by infinity. sbeattie\u003e For existing releases, DO NOT APPLY THIS PATCH due to ABI breakage. Fix will come in to 17.10 when we get glibc-2.25 as we do not guarantee ABI for libresolv internals across different glibc releases, just for upgrades for same versions e.g. (2.24 -\u003e 2.24) REPEAT: DO NOT APPLY THIS PATCH (UNMODIFIED) IN A STABLE RELEASE mdeslaur\u003e marking this issue as ignored, as we will not be fixing this mdeslaur\u003e in Ubuntu stable releases.",
