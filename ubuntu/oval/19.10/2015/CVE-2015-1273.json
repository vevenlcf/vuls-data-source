  "description": "Heap-based buffer overflow in j2k.c in OpenJPEG before r3002, as used in PDFium in Google Chrome before 44.0.2403.89, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via invalid JPEG2000 data in a PDF document.",
  "note": "tyhicks\u003e There are large changes between openjpeg trunk and the 1.5 and 1.3 branches that we shipped in Vivid and older. However, it looks like those code bases are also affected because I don't see similar sanity checks. As of 2015-07-24, I don't see a fix in the 1.5 branch.",
