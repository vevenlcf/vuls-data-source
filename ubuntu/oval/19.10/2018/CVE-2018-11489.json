  "title": "CVE-2018-11489 on Ubuntu 19.10 (eoan) - low.",
  "description": "The DGifDecompressLine function in dgif_lib.c in GIFLIB (possibly version 3.0.x), as later shipped in cgif.c in sam2p 0.49.4, has a heap-based buffer overflow because a certain CrntCode array index is not checked. This will lead to a denial of service or possibly unspecified other impact.",
