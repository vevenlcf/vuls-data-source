  "title": "CVE-2018-4056 on Ubuntu 19.10 (eoan) - medium.",
  "description": "An exploitable SQL injection vulnerability exists in the administrator web portal function of coTURN prior to version 4.5.0.9. A login message with a specially crafted username can cause an SQL injection, resulting in authentication bypass, which could give access to the TURN server administrator web portal. An attacker can log in via the external interface of the TURN server to trigger this vulnerability.",
  "note": "ebarretto\u003e As the administration web interface is shared with the production, ebarretto\u003e it is unfortunately not possible to easily filter outside access ebarretto\u003e and this security update completely disable the web interface. ebarretto\u003e Users should use the local, command line interface instead.",
