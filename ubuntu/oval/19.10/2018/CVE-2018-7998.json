  "description": "In libvips before 8.6.3, a NULL function pointer dereference vulnerability was found in the vips_region_generate function in region.c, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted image file. This occurs because of a race condition involving a failed delayed load and other worker threads.",
