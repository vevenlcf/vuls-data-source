  "description": "An issue was discovered in OpenJPEG 2.3.0. Missing checks for header_info.height and header_info.width in the function pnmtoimage in bin/jpwl/convert.c can lead to a heap-based buffer overflow. It was discovered that OpenJPEG incorrectly handled certain PNM files. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service.",
