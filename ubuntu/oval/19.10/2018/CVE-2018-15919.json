  "title": "CVE-2018-15919 on Ubuntu 19.10 (eoan) - low.",
  "description": "Remotely observable behaviour in auth-gss2.c in OpenSSH through 7.8 could be used by remote attackers to detect existence of users on a target system when GSS2 is in use. NOTE: the discoverer states 'We understand that the OpenSSH developers do not want to treat such a username enumeration (or \"oracle\") as a vulnerability.'",
  "note": "sarnold\u003e openssh-ssh1 is provided for compatibility with old devices that cannot be upgraded to modern protocols. Thus we may not provide security support for this package if doing so would prevent access to equipment. mdeslaur\u003e SUSE reverted the fix for this issue because of a regression mdeslaur\u003e mdeslaur\u003e per the post to oss-security, upstream doesn't conside this to mdeslaur\u003e be a security issue, and as of 2020-07-07, there is no upstream mdeslaur\u003e fix for this. We will not be fixing this issue in Ubuntu.",
