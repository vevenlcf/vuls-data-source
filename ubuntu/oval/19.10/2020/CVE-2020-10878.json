  "description": "Perl before 5.30.3 has an integer overflow related to mishandling of a \"PL_regkind[OP(n)] == NOTHING\" situation. A crafted regular expression could lead to malformed bytecode with a possibility of instruction injection. Perl before 5.30.3 has an integer overflow related to mishandling of a \"PL_regkind[OP(n)] == NOTHING\" situation. A crafted regular expression could lead to malformed bytecode with a possibility of instruction injection. An application written in Perl would only be vulnerable to this flaw if it evaluates regular expressions supplied by the attacker. Evaluating regular expressions in this fashion is known to be dangerous since the regular expression engine does not protect against denial of service attacks in this usage scenario.]",
