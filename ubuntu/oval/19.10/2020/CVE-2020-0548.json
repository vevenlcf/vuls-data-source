  "title": "CVE-2020-0548 on Ubuntu 19.10 (eoan) - medium.",
  "description": "Cleanup errors in some Intel(R) Processors may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable information disclosure via local access. It was discovered that on some Intel processors, partial data values previously read from a vector register on a physical core may be propagated into unused portions of the store buffer. A local attacker could possible use this to expose sensitive information.",
