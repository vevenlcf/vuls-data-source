  "title": "CVE-2020-15720 on Ubuntu 19.10 (eoan) - medium.",
  "description": "In Dogtag PKI through 10.8.3, the pki.client.PKIConnection class did not enable python-requests certificate validation. Since the verify parameter was hard-coded in all request functions, it was not possible to override the setting. As a result, tools making use of this class, such as the pki-server command, may have been vulnerable to Person-in-the-Middle attacks in certain non-localhost use cases. This is fixed in 10.9.0-b1.",
