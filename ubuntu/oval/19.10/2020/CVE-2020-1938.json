  "title": "CVE-2020-1938 on Ubuntu 19.10 (eoan) - medium.",
  "description": "When using the Apache JServ Protocol (AJP), care must be taken when trusting incoming connections to Apache Tomcat. Tomcat treats AJP connections as having higher trust than, for example, a similar HTTP connection. If such connections are available to an attacker, they can be exploited in ways that may be surprising. In Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.30, 8.5.0 to 8.5.50 and 7.0.0 to 7.0.99, Tomcat shipped with an AJP Connector enabled by default that listened on all configured IP addresses. It was expected (and recommended in the security guide) that this Connector would be disabled if not required. This vulnerability report identified a mechanism that allowed: - returning arbitrary files from anywhere in the web application - processing any file in the web application as a JSP Further, if the web application allowed file upload and stored those files within the web application (or the attacker was able to control the content of the web application by some other means) then this, along with the ability to process a file as a JSP, made remote code execution possible. It is important to note that mitigation is only required if an AJP port is accessible to untrusted users. Users wishing to take a defence-in-depth approach and block the vector that permits returning arbitrary files and execution as JSP may upgrade to Apache Tomcat 9.0.31, 8.5.51 or 7.0.100 or later. A number of changes were made to the default AJP Connector configuration in 9.0.31 to harden the default configuration. It is likely that users upgrading to 9.0.31, 8.5.51 or 7.0.100 or later will need to make small changes to their configurations.",
  "note": "mdeslaur\u003e In Ubuntu packages, the AJP connector is disabled by default, mdeslaur\u003e so unless specifically enabled by an admin, deployments made mdeslaur\u003e using the package are not vulnerable to this issue. mdeslaur\u003e mdeslaur\u003e Marking this CVE as \"low\" priority, as even though the AJP mdeslaur\u003e connector is disabled, it is desirable to include the hardening mdeslaur\u003e patches in a future security update for environments where the mdeslaur\u003e connector has been manually enabled. amurray\u003e Marking this CVE as \"medium\" since a number of customers and amurray\u003e users do enable this feature even though we disable it by default mdeslaur\u003e code in 8.0.x is substantially different, and no backport is mdeslaur\u003e currently available as of 2020-07-07",
