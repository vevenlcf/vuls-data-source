  "title": "CVE-2020-11884 on Ubuntu 19.10 (eoan) - high.",
  "description": "In the Linux kernel through 5.6.7 on the s390 platform, code execution may occur because of a race condition, as demonstrated by code in enable_sacf_uaccess in arch/s390/lib/uaccess.c that fails to protect against a concurrent page table upgrade, aka CID-3f777e19d171. A crash could also occur. Al Viro discovered that the Linux kernel for s390x systems did not properly perform page table upgrades for kernel sections that use secondary address mode. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code.",
