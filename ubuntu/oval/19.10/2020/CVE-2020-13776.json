  "description": "systemd through v245 mishandles numerical usernames such as ones composed of decimal digits or 0x followed by hex digits, as demonstrated by use of root privileges when privileges of the 0x0 user account were intended. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2017-1000082.",
  "note": "mdeslaur\u003e The administrator would have to create a systemd service unit mdeslaur\u003e with a numerical username or a username starting with 0x as a mdeslaur\u003e User= value, and that particular userid would need to exist on mdeslaur\u003e the system. Setting priority to low due to this unlikely mdeslaur\u003e scenario.",
