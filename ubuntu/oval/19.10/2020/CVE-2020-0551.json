  "description": "Load value injection in some Intel(R) Processors utilizing speculative execution may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable information disclosure via a side channel with local access. The list of affected products is provided in intel-sa-00334: https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/advisory/intel-sa-00334.html",
  "note": "sbeattie\u003e only affects processors from Intel sbeattie\u003e primary impact is for SGX users. May need toolchain updates for applications that are targeted for use in SGX enclaves. sbeattie\u003e most Ubuntu kernels do not support or have SGX drivers available, and so are not affected. The linux-azure kernels do have SGX enabled (as of https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-azure/+bug/1844245 ) and thus the Ubuntu Kernel team is investigating further. The guidance that we have received so far from Intel indicates that it is only SGX applications that need mitigations.",
