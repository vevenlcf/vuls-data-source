  "description": "Minimatch is a minimal matching utility that works by converting glob expressions into JavaScript `RegExp` objects. The primary function, `minimatch(path, pattern)` in Minimatch 3.0.1 and earlier is vulnerable to ReDoS in the `pattern` parameter. It was discovered that Minimatch did not perform necessary bounds checking on regular expressions. An attacker could use this vulnerability to cause a denial of service.",
