  "description": "sudo before version 1.8.18p1 is vulnerable to a bypass in the sudo noexec restriction if application run via sudo executed wordexp() C library function with a user supplied argument. A local user permitted to run such application via sudo with noexec restriction could possibly use this flaw to execute arbitrary commands with elevated privileges.",
  "note": "sarnold\u003e See also CVE-2016-7032 sarnold\u003e This alert mentions a seccomp-based filter. If we decide to backport that filter for this CVE, and CVE-2016-7032, then 'medium' may continue to be appropriate. If we decide the seccomp-based filter is not suitable for a backport, then perhaps 'negligible' would be appropriate.",
