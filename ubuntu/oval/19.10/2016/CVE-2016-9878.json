  "description": "An issue was discovered in Pivotal Spring Framework before 3.2.18, 4.2.x before 4.2.9, and 4.3.x before 4.3.5. Paths provided to the ResourceServlet were not properly sanitized and as a result exposed to directory traversal attacks. It was discovered that Spring Framework incorrectly handled path inputs. An attacker could possibly use this issue to read arbitrary files.",
