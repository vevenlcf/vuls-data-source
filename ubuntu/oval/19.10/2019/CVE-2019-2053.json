  "description": "In wnm_parse_neighbor_report_elem of wnm_sta.c, there is a possible out-of-bounds read due to missing bounds check.

  "note": "mdeslaur\u003e per upstream: The actual read bytes would be stored locally, mdeslaur\u003e but they were not used for anything, so other than reading mdeslaur\u003e beyond the end of an allocated heap memory buffer, this did not mdeslaur\u003e result in any behavior difference or exposure of the bytes.",
