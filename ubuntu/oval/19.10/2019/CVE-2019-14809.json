  "title": "CVE-2019-14809 on Ubuntu 19.10 (eoan) - medium.",
  "description": "net/url in Go before 1.11.13 and 1.12.x before 1.12.8 mishandles malformed hosts in URLs, leading to an authorization bypass in some applications. This is related to a Host field with a suffix appearing in neither Hostname() nor Port(), and is related to a non-numeric port number. For example, an attacker can compose a crafted javascript:// URL that results in a hostname of google.com.",
  "note": "mdeslaur\u003e Packages built using golang need to be rebuilt once the mdeslaur\u003e vulnerability has been fixed. This CVE entry does not mdeslaur\u003e list packages that need rebuilding outside of the main mdeslaur\u003e repository or the Ubuntu variants with PPA overlays.",
