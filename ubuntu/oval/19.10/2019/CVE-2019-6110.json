  "title": "CVE-2019-6110 on Ubuntu 19.10 (eoan) - low.",
  "description": "In OpenSSH 7.9, due to accepting and displaying arbitrary stderr output from the server, a malicious server (or Man-in-The-Middle attacker) can manipulate the client output, for example to use ANSI control codes to hide additional files being transferred.",
  "note": "sarnold\u003e openssh-ssh1 is provided for compatibility with old devices that cannot be upgraded to modern protocols. Thus we may not provide security support for this package if doing so would prevent access to equipment. mdeslaur\u003e mdeslaur\u003e The recommended workaround for this issue is to switch to using mdeslaur\u003e sftp instead of scp. mdeslaur\u003e mdeslaur\u003e Per https://lists.mindrot.org/pipermail/openssh-unix-dev/2019-January/037475.html mdeslaur\u003e upstream doesn't consider this to be a vulnerability, and as of mdeslaur\u003e 2020-07-07, there is no upstream fix. We will not be fixing mdeslaur\u003e this issue in Ubuntu stable releases.",
