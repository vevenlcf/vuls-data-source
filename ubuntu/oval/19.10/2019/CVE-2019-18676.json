  "title": "CVE-2019-18676 on Ubuntu 19.10 (eoan) - medium.",
  "description": "An issue was discovered in Squid 3.x and 4.x through 4.8. Due to incorrect input validation, there is a heap-based buffer overflow that can result in Denial of Service to all clients using the proxy. Severity is high due to this vulnerability occurring before normal security checks; any remote client that can reach the proxy port can trivially perform the attack via a crafted URI scheme.",
  "note": "mdeslaur\u003e same fix as CVE-2019-12523 mdeslaur\u003e This was fixed in 4.x by rewriting the URI parser to use SBuf. mdeslaur\u003e Backporting the 4.x commit to 3.x is problematic. mdeslaur\u003e As of 2020-06-18, no backport to 3.x is available, and no mdeslaur\u003e details or reproducer for the issue is available to develop a mdeslaur\u003e specific fix for 3.x.",
