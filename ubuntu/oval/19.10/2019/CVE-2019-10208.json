  "title": "CVE-2019-10208 on Ubuntu 19.10 (eoan) - medium.",
  "description": "A flaw was discovered in postgresql versions 9.4.x before 9.4.24, 9.5.x before 9.5.19, 9.6.x before 9.6.15, 10.x before 10.10 and 11.x before 11.5 where arbitrary SQL statements can be executed given a suitable SECURITY DEFINER function. An attacker, with EXECUTE permission on the function, can execute arbitrary SQL as the owner of the function. Tom Lane discovered that PostgreSQL did not properly restrict functions declared as \"SECURITY DEFINER\". An attacker could use this to execute arbitrary SQL with the permissions of the function owner.",
  "note": "leosilva\u003e since 9.3 is not supported anymore by upstream leosilva\u003e and for now we don't have how to patch it leosilva\u003e I'm marking it as ignored.",
