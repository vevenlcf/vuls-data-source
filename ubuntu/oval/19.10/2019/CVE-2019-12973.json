  "description": "In OpenJPEG 2.3.1, there is excessive iteration in the opj_t1_encode_cblks function of openjp2/t1.c. Remote attackers could leverage this vulnerability to cause a denial of service via a crafted bmp file. This issue is similar to CVE-2018-6616. It was discovered that OpenJPEG incorrectly handled certain BMP files. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service.",
