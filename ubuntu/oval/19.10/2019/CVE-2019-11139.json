  "description": "Improper conditions check in the voltage modulation interface for some Intel(R) Xeon(R) Scalable Processors may allow a privileged user to potentially enable denial of service via local access. It was discovered that certain Intel Xeon processors did not properly restrict access to a voltage modulation interface. A local privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
