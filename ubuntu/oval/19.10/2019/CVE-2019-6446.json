  "description": "** DISPUTED **   An issue was discovered in NumPy 1.16.0 and earlier. It uses the pickle Python module unsafely, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted serialized object, as demonstrated by a numpy.load call. NOTE: third parties dispute this issue because it is  a behavior that might have legitimate applications in (for example)  loading serialized Python object arrays from trusted and authenticated  sources.",
  "note": "mdeslaur\u003e The following commit added an option that will allow disabling mdeslaur\u003e the use of pickles in load and save operations: mdeslaur\u003e https://github.com/numpy/numpy/commit/a2bd3a7eabfe053d6d16a2130fdcad9e5211f6bb mdeslaur\u003e mdeslaur\u003e That commit is included in xenial+ mdeslaur\u003e mdeslaur\u003e Marking this as low priority due to the limited reverse-depends mdeslaur\u003e in main, and the fact that it may not be possible to switch the mdeslaur\u003e default to false in stable releases without breaking use-cases.",
