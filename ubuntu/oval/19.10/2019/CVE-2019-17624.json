  "description": "\"\" In X.Org X Server 1.20.4, there is a stack-based buffer overflow in the function XQueryKeymap. For example, by sending ct.c_char 1000 times, an attacker can cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact. Note: It is disputed if the X.Org X Server is involved or if there is a stack overflow.",
