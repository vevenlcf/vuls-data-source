  "title": "CVE-2019-2684 on Ubuntu 19.10 (eoan) - medium.",
  "description": "Vulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded component of Oracle Java SE (subcomponent: RMI). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 7u211, 8u202, 11.0.2 and 12; Java SE Embedded: 8u201. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized creation, deletion or modification access to critical data or all Java SE, Java SE Embedded accessible data. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets (in Java SE 8), that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability can also be exploited by using APIs in the specified Component, e.g., through a web service which supplies data to the APIs. CVSS 3.0 Base Score 5.9 (Integrity impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N). Corwin de Boor and Robert Xiao discovered that the RMI registry implementation in OpenJDK did not properly select the correct skeleton class in some situations. An attacker could use this to possibly escape Java sandbox restrictions.",
