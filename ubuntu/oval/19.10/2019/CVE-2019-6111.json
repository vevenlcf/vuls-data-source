  "title": "CVE-2019-6111 on Ubuntu 19.10 (eoan) - low.",
  "description": "An issue was discovered in OpenSSH 7.9. Due to the scp implementation being derived from 1983 rcp, the server chooses which files/directories are sent to the client. However, the scp client only performs cursory validation of the object name returned (only directory traversal attacks are prevented). A malicious scp server (or Man-in-The-Middle attacker) can overwrite arbitrary files in the scp client target directory. If recursive operation (-r) is performed, the server can manipulate subdirectories as well (for example, to overwrite the .ssh/authorized_keys file).",
  "note": "sarnold\u003e openssh-ssh1 is provided for compatibility with old devices that cannot be upgraded to modern protocols. Thus we may not provide security support for this package if doing so would prevent access to equipment. mdeslaur\u003e mdeslaur\u003e The recommended workaround for this issue is to switch to using mdeslaur\u003e sftp instead of scp. mdeslaur\u003e mdeslaur\u003e The updates in USN-3885-1 inverted two CVE numbers by accident. mdeslaur\u003e mdeslaur\u003e The initial USN was incomplete and did not include the second mdeslaur\u003e commit.",
