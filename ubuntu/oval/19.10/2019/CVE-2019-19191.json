  "title": "CVE-2019-19191 on Ubuntu 19.10 (eoan) - low.",
  "description": "Shibboleth Service Provider (SP) 3.x before 3.1.0 shipped a spec file that calls chown on files in a directory controlled by the service user (the shibd account) after installation. This allows the user to escalate to root by pointing symlinks to files such as /etc/shadow.",
  "note": "ebarretto\u003e According to Debian: ebarretto\u003e This is an issue in the upstream provided spec file which is not ebarretto\u003e relevant for the binary packages build in Debian (fixed upstream in ebarretto\u003e 3.1.0). The postinst in the Debian packaging does not have similar ebarretto\u003e problematic chown logic.",
