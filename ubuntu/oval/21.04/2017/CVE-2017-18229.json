  "title": "CVE-2017-18229 on Ubuntu 21.04 (hirsute) - medium.",
  "description": "An issue was discovered in GraphicsMagick 1.3.26. An allocation failure vulnerability was found in the function ReadTIFFImage in coders/tiff.c, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service via a crafted file, because file size is not properly used to restrict scanline, strip, and tile allocations. It was discovered that GraphicsMagick incorrectly handled certain image files. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or other unspecified impact.",
