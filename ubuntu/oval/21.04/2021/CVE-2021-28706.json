  "title": "CVE-2021-28706 on Ubuntu 21.04 (hirsute) - medium.",
  "description": "guests may exceed their designated memory limit When a guest is permitted to have close to 16TiB of memory, it may be able to issue hypercalls to increase its memory allocation beyond the administrator established limit. This is a result of a calculation done with 32-bit precision, which may overflow. It would then only be the overflowed (and hence small) number which gets compared against the established upper bound.",
