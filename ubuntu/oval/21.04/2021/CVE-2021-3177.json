  "title": "CVE-2021-3177 on Ubuntu 21.04 (hirsute) - medium.",
  "description": "Python 3.x through 3.9.1 has a buffer overflow in PyCArg_repr in _ctypes/callproc.c, which may lead to remote code execution in certain Python applications that accept floating-point numbers as untrusted input, as demonstrated by a 1e300 argument to c_double.from_param. This occurs because sprintf is used unsafely.",
  "note": "mdeslaur\u003e on Ubuntu, binaries are compiled with Fortify Source, so exploiting this issue will likely only cause Python to crash, leading to a denial of service.",
