  "title": "CVE-2020-14309 on Ubuntu 21.04 (hirsute) - high.",
  "description": "There's an issue with grub2 in all versions before 2.06 when handling squashfs filesystems containing a symbolic link with name length of UINT32 bytes in size. The name size leads to an arithmetic overflow leading to a zero-size allocation further causing a heap-based buffer overflow with attacker controlled data. Chris Coulson discovered that multiple integer overflows existed in GRUB2 when handling certain filesystems or font files, leading to heap-based buffer overflows. A local attacker could use these to execute arbitrary code and bypass UEFI Secure Boot restrictions.",
