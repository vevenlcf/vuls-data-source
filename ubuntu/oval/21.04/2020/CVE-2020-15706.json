  "title": "CVE-2020-15706 on Ubuntu 21.04 (hirsute) - high.",
  "description": "GRUB2 contains a race condition in grub_script_function_create() leading to a use-after-free vulnerability which can be triggered by redefining a function whilst the same function is already executing, leading to arbitrary code execution and secure boot restriction bypass. This issue affects GRUB2 version 2.04 and prior versions. Chris Coulson discovered that the GRUB2 function handling code did not properly handle a function being redefined, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to execute arbitrary code and bypass UEFI Secure Boot restrictions.",
