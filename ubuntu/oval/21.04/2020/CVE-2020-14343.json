  "title": "CVE-2020-14343 on Ubuntu 21.04 (hirsute) - medium.",
  "description": "A vulnerability was discovered in the PyYAML library in versions before 5.4, where it is susceptible to arbitrary code execution when it processes untrusted YAML files through the full_load method or with the FullLoader loader. Applications that use the library to process untrusted input may be vulnerable to this flaw. This flaw allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system by abusing the python/object/new constructor. This flaw is due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2020-1747.",
  "note": "sbeattie\u003e incomplete fix of CVE-2020-1747 mdeslaur\u003e FullLoader was introduced in 5.1. FullLoader should not be used on untrusted input.",
