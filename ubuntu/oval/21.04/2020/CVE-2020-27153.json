  "title": "CVE-2020-27153 on Ubuntu 21.04 (hirsute) - low.",
  "description": "In BlueZ before 5.55, a double free was found in the gatttool disconnect_cb() routine from shared/att.c. A remote attacker could potentially cause a denial of service or code execution, during service discovery, due to a redundant disconnect MGMT event.",
  "note": "mdeslaur\u003e per Red Hat, there is currently no known path to code execution as there is a small time window between the two calls to free() as such, marking as low priority.",
