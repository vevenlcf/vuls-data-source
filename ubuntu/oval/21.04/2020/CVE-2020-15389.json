  "title": "CVE-2020-15389 on Ubuntu 21.04 (hirsute) - low.",
  "description": "jp2/opj_decompress.c in OpenJPEG through 2.3.1 has a use-after-free that can be triggered if there is a mix of valid and invalid files in a directory operated on by the decompressor. Triggering a double-free may also be possible. This is related to calling opj_image_destroy twice. It was discovered that OpenJPEG did not properly handle certain input. If OpenJPEG were supplied with specially crafted input, it could be made to crash or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
  "note": "mdeslaur\u003e per upstream bug, this is a read after free, so likely limited to a denial of service.",
