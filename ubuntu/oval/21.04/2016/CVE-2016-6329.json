  "description": "OpenVPN, when using a 64-bit block cipher, makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain cleartext data via a birthday attack against a long-duration encrypted session, as demonstrated by an HTTP-over-OpenVPN session using Blowfish in CBC mode, aka a \"Sweet32\" attack.",
  "note": "mdeslaur\u003e openvpn 2.3 and earlier use BF-CBC by default unless the cipher is specified manually. 2.3.12 was modified to display a warning if a 64-bit cipher is selected. Since this is just a warning, downgrading priority to low sbeattie\u003e fixed in 2.4.0",
