  "title": "CVE-2011-3170 on Ubuntu 21.04 (hirsute) - medium.",
  "description": "The gif_read_lzw function in filter/image-gif.c in CUPS 1.4.8 and earlier does not properly handle the first code word in an LZW stream, which allows remote attackers to trigger a heap-based buffer overflow, and possibly execute arbitrary code, via a crafted stream, a different vulnerability than CVE-2011-2896.",
  "note": "mdeslaur\u003e This also affects cups 1.5.x and isn't fixed in 1.5.0 gimp was fixed correctly with a single commit, so doesn't have this issue, which is an incomplete fix.",
