  "title": "CVE-2019-8354 on Ubuntu 21.04 (hirsute) - medium.",
  "description": "An issue was discovered in SoX 14.4.2. lsx_make_lpf in effect_i_dsp.c has an integer overflow on the result of multiplication fed into malloc. When the buffer is allocated, it is smaller than expected, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow. It was discovered that SoX incorrectly handled certain MP3 files. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2019-8354, CVE-2019-8355, CVE-2019-8356, CVE-2019-8357)",
