  "description": "An issue was discovered in Squid before 4.9. When handling a URN request, a corresponding HTTP request is made. This HTTP request doesn't go through the access checks that incoming HTTP requests go through. This causes all access checks to be bypassed and allows access to restricted HTTP servers, e.g., an attacker can connect to HTTP servers that only listen on localhost.",
  "note": "mdeslaur\u003e This was fixed in 4.x by rewriting the URI parser to use SBuf. fixed in Debian's 3.5.23-5+deb9u2",
