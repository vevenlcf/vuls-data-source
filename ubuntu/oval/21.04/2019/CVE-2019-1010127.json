The component is: The header::add_FILTER_descriptor method in header.cpp. The attack vector is: The victim must open a specially crafted VCF file. It was discovered that VCFtools improperly handled memory allocation/deallocation, resulting in a use-after-free vulnerability. If a victim were tricked into opening a specially crafted VCF File, an attacker could cause VCFtools to leak sensitive information or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
