  "title": "CVE-2018-14938 on Ubuntu 21.04 (hirsute) - medium.",
  "description": "An issue was discovered in wifipcap/wifipcap.cpp in TCPFLOW through 1.5.0-alpha. There is an integer overflow in the function handle_prism during caplen processing. If the caplen is less than 144, one can cause an integer overflow in the function handle_80211, which will result in an out-of-bounds read and may allow access to sensitive memory (or a denial of service). It was discovered that tcpflow mishandled certain crafted input, resulting in an integer overflow. An attacker could use this vulnerability to leak sensitive information or cause a denial of service (crash).",
