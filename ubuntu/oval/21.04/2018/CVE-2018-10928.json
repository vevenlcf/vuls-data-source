  "description": "A flaw was found in RPC request using gfs3_symlink_req in glusterfs server which allows symlink destinations to point to file paths outside of the gluster volume. An authenticated attacker could use this flaw to create arbitrary symlinks pointing anywhere on the server and execute arbitrary code on glusterfs server nodes. It was discovered that GlusterFS incorrectly handled RPC requests. An attacker could possibly use this issue to write iles to an arbitrary location and execute arbitrary code.",
