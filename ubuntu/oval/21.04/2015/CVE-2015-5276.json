  "title": "CVE-2015-5276 on Ubuntu 21.04 (hirsute) - low.",
  "description": "The std::random_device class in libstdc++ in the GNU Compiler Collection (aka GCC) before 4.9.4 does not properly handle short reads from blocking sources, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to predict the random values via unspecified vectors.",
  "note": "tyhicks\u003e Note that upstream revision 227687 is incomplete/incorrect. See msg01050.html for a more complete patch that is undergoing review. In gcc-4.7 through gcc-4.8, the code in question exists at libstdc++-v3/include/tr1/random.h and libstdc++-v3/include/bits/random.h In gcc-4.4, the code in question exists at libstdc++-v3/include/tr1_impl/random sbeattie\u003e Note that for versions where the random_device() code in question is in a header file, means that it's compiled into the binaries built against libstdc++, which would need to be rebuilt to get the fixed version. upstream commits (so far) are listed under gcc-snapshots package.
