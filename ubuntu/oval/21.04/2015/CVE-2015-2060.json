  "description": "cabextract before 1.6 does not properly check for leading slashes when extracting files, which allows remote attackers to conduct absolute directory traversal attacks via a malformed UTF-8 character that is changed to a UTF-8 encoded slash. It was discovered that cabextract incorrectly handled certain malformed CAB files. A remote attacker could use this issue to write to arbitrary files on the host filesystem.",
