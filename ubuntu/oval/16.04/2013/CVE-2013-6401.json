  "title": "CVE-2013-6401 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium.",
  "description": "Jansson, possibly 2.4 and earlier, does not restrict the ability to trigger hash collisions predictably, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a crafted JSON document. Florian Weimer discovered that Jansson incorrectly handled hash collisions predictability. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2013-6401` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibjansson4 - 2.6-1\nNo subscription required",
