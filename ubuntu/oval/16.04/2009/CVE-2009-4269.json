  "title": "CVE-2009-4269 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium.",
  "description": "The password hash generation algorithm in the BUILTIN authentication functionality for Apache Derby before 10.6.1.0 performs a transformation that reduces the size of the set of inputs to SHA-1, which produces a small search space that makes it easier for local and possibly remote attackers to crack passwords by generating hash collisions, related to password substitution.",
