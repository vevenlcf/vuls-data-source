  "description": "The tm_adopt function in lib/Libifl/tm.c in Terascale Open-Source Resource and Queue Manager (aka TORQUE Resource Manager) 5.0.x, 4.5.x, 4.2.x, and earlier does not validate that the owner of the process also owns the adopted session id, which allows remote authenticated users to kill arbitrary processes via a crafted executable. It was discovered that TORQUE Resource Manager does not validate that the owner of the process also owns the adopted session id. A remote authenticated attacker could possibly use this to kill arbitrary processes.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2014-3684` to fix the vulnerability.
