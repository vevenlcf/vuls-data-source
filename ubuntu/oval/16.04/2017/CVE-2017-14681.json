  "title": "CVE-2017-14681 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium.",
  "description": "The daemon in P3Scan 3.0_rc1 and earlier creates a p3scan.pid file after dropping privileges to a non-root account, which might allow local users to kill arbitrary processes by leveraging access to this non-root account for p3scan.pid modification before a root script executes a \"kill `cat /pathname/p3scan.pid`\" command, as demonstrated by etc/init.d/p3scan.",
