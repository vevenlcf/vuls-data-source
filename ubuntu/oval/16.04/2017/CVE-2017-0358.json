  "description": "Jann Horn of Google Project Zero discovered that NTFS-3G, a read-write NTFS driver for FUSE, does not scrub the environment before executing modprobe with elevated privileges. A local user can take advantage of this flaw for local root privilege escalation.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2017-0358` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nntfs-3g - 1:2015.3.14AR.1-1ubuntu0.1\nNo subscription required",
  "note": "tyhicks\u003e 14.04 and 12.04 are not affected since ntfs-3g is not installed setuid-root. While there is some debconf support for setting ntfs-3g as setuid-root in the packaging, libfuse refuses to cooperate when it detects that it is running in a setuid environment.",
