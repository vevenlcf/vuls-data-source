  "title": "CVE-2017-12374 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium.",
  "description": "The ClamAV AntiVirus software versions 0.99.2 and prior contain a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to a lack of input validation checking mechanisms during certain mail parsing operations (mbox.c operations on bounce messages). If successfully exploited, the ClamAV software could allow a variable pointing to the mail body which could cause a used after being free (use-after-free) instance which may lead to a disruption of services on an affected device to include a denial of service condition.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2017-12374` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nclamav - 0.99.3+addedllvm-0ubuntu0.16.04.1\nclamav-base - 0.99.3+addedllvm-0ubuntu0.16.04.1\nclamav-daemon - 0.99.3+addedllvm-0ubuntu0.16.04.1\nclamav-freshclam - 0.99.3+addedllvm-0ubuntu0.16.04.1\nclamav-milter - 0.99.3+addedllvm-0ubuntu0.16.04.1\nclamav-testfiles - 0.99.3+addedllvm-0ubuntu0.16.04.1\nclamdscan - 0.99.3+addedllvm-0ubuntu0.16.04.1\nlibclamav9 - 0.99.3+addedllvm-0ubuntu0.16.04.1\nNo subscription required",
