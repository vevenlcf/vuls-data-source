  "title": "CVE-2017-3731 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium.",
  "description": "If an SSL/TLS server or client is running on a 32-bit host, and a specific cipher is being used, then a truncated packet can cause that server or client to perform an out-of-bounds read, usually resulting in a crash. For OpenSSL 1.1.0, the crash can be triggered when using CHACHA20/POLY1305; users should upgrade to 1.1.0d. For Openssl 1.0.2, the crash can be triggered when using RC4-MD5; users who have not disabled that algorithm should update to 1.0.2k.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2017-3731` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibssl1.0.0 - 1.0.2g-1ubuntu4.6\nopenssl - 1.0.2g-1ubuntu4.6\nNo subscription required",
