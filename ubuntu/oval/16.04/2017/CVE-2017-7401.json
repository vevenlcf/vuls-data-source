  "title": "CVE-2017-7401 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium.",
  "description": "Incorrect interaction of the parse_packet() and parse_part_sign_sha256() functions in network.c in collectd 5.7.1 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop) of a collectd instance (configured with \"SecurityLevel None\" and with empty \"AuthFile\" options) via a crafted UDP packet. It was discovered that collectd mishandles certain malformed network packets. A remote attacker could use this vulnerablity to cause a Denial of Service or consume system resources.",
