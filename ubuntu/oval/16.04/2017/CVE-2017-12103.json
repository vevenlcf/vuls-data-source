  "title": "CVE-2017-12103 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium.",
  "description": "An exploitable integer overflow exists in the way that the Blender open-source 3d creation suite v2.78c converts text rendered as a font into a curve. A specially crafted .blend file can cause an integer overflow resulting in a buffer overflow which can allow for code execution under the context of the application. An attacker can convince a user to open the file or use the file as a library in order to trigger this vulnerability.",
