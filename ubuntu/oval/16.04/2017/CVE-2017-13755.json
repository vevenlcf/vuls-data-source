  "description": "In The Sleuth Kit (TSK) 4.4.2, opening a crafted ISO 9660 image triggers an out-of-bounds read in iso9660_proc_dir() in tsk/fs/iso9660_dent.c in libtskfs.a, as demonstrated by fls. It was discovered that The Sleuth Kit mishandled certain crafted ISO 9660 images. If an analyst were tricked into opening a malicious image, an attacker could cause a denial of service (crash).",
