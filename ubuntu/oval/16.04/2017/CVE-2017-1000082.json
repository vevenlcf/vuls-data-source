  "title": "CVE-2017-1000082 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - low.",
  "description": "systemd v233 and earlier fails to safely parse usernames starting with a numeric digit (e.g. \"0day\"), running the service in question with root privileges rather than the user intended.",
  "note": "mdeslaur\u003e the upstream patch changes behaviour to cause a unit to fail to load if a configuration item could not be parsed, instead of skipping it. Fixing this may cause regressions in certain environments. We will not be fixing this issue in xenial. Administrators are encouraged to carefully audit their unit files and make sure the options are being parsed correctly.",
