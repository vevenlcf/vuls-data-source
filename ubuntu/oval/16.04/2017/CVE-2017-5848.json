  "title": "CVE-2017-5848 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - low.",
  "description": "The gst_ps_demux_parse_psm function in gst/mpegdemux/gstmpegdemux.c in gst-plugins-bad in GStreamer allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (invalid memory read and crash) via vectors involving PSM parsing. Hanno Böck discovered that GStreamer Bad Plug-ins incorrectly handled vectors involving PSM parsing. A remote attacker could exploit this with a crafted media file to cause GStreamer to crash, resulting in a denial of service.",
