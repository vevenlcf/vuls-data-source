  "title": "CVE-2017-8906 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium.",
  "description": "An integer underflow vulnerability exists in pixel-a.asm, the x86 assembly code for planeClipAndMax() in MulticoreWare x265 through 2.4, as used by the x265_encoder_encode dependency in libbpg and other products. A small picture can cause an integer underflow, which leads to a Denial of Service in the process of encoding.",
  "note": "msalvatore\u003e Affected code is *NOT* disabled in xenial. Xenial is affected. Upstream has not released a patch, rather, they have \"disabled 'planeClipAndMax' assembly primitives\"",
