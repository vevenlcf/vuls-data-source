  "title": "CVE-2017-13693 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - negligible.",
  "description": "The acpi_ds_create_operands() function in drivers/acpi/acpica/dsutils.c in the Linux kernel through 4.12.9 does not flush the operand cache and causes a kernel stack dump, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory and bypass the KASLR protection mechanism (in the kernel through 4.9) via a crafted ACPI table.",
  "note": "tyhicks\u003e As of 17.04, KASLR is not yet enabled by default in Ubuntu See the patchwork.k.o reference for a possible fix. As of 2018-10-01, it has not yet been merged upstream.",
