  "description": "Insufficient checks in the UDF subsystem in Firebird 2.5.x before 2.5.7 and 3.0.x before 3.0.2 allow remote authenticated users to execute code by using a 'system' entrypoint from fbudf.so. It was discovered that Firebird exposed certain UDF libraries. An authenticated attacker could use this issue to execute arbitrary code.",
