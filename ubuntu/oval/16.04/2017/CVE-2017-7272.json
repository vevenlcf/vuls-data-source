  "title": "CVE-2017-7272 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - low.",
  "description": "PHP through 7.1.11 enables potential SSRF in applications that accept an fsockopen or pfsockopen hostname argument with an expectation that the port number is constrained. Because a :port syntax is recognized, fsockopen will use the port number that is specified in the hostname argument, instead of the port number in the second argument of the function.",
  "note": "mdeslaur\u003e the change in behaviour broke applications relying on undocumented behaviour so was reverted in subsequent releases We will not be fixing this in stable releases. Marking as ignored.",
