  "title": "CVE-2017-12982 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - low.",
  "description": "The bmp_read_info_header function in bin/jp2/convertbmp.c in OpenJPEG 2.2.0 does not reject headers with a zero biBitCount, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory allocation failure) in the opj_image_create function in lib/openjp2/image.c, related to the opj_aligned_alloc_n function in opj_malloc.c. It was discovered that OpenJPEG incorrectly handled certain image files. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service.",
