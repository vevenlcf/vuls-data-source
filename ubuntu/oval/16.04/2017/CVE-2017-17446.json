  "title": "CVE-2017-17446 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium.",
  "description": "The Mem_File_Reader::read_avail function in Data_Reader.cpp in the Game_Music_Emu library (aka game-music-emu) 0.6.1 does not ensure a non-negative size, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a crafted file. It was discovered that game-music-emu mishandled certain crafted input. A local attacker could use this vulnerability to cause game-music-emu to crash.",
