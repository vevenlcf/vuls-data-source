  "description": "A double-free bug in the read_gif function in gifread.c in gifsicle 1.90 allows a remote attacker to cause a denial-of-service attack or unspecified other impact via a maliciously crafted file, because last_name is mishandled, a different vulnerability than CVE-2017-1000421. It was discovered that Gifsicle did not properly handle certain input. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious GIF, an attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code.",
