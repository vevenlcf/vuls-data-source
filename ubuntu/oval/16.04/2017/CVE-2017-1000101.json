  "title": "CVE-2017-1000101 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - low.",
  "description": "curl supports \"globbing\" of URLs, in which a user can pass a numerical range to have the tool iterate over those numbers to do a sequence of transfers. In the globbing function that parses the numerical range, there was an omission that made curl read a byte beyond the end of the URL if given a carefully crafted, or just wrongly written, URL. The URL is stored in a heap based buffer, so it could then be made to wrongly read something else instead of crashing. An example of a URL that triggers the flaw would be `http://ur%20[0-60000000000000000000`.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2017-1000101` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ncurl - 7.47.0-1ubuntu2.3\nlibcurl3 - 7.47.0-1ubuntu2.3\nlibcurl3-gnutls - 7.47.0-1ubuntu2.3\nlibcurl3-nss - 7.47.0-1ubuntu2.3\nNo subscription required",
