  "title": "CVE-2017-7572 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - low.",
  "description": "The _checkPolkitPrivilege function in serviceHelper.py in Back In Time (aka backintime) 1.1.18 and earlier uses a deprecated polkit authorization method (unix-process) that is subject to a race condition (time of check, time of use). With this authorization method, the owner of a process requesting a polkit operation is checked by polkitd via /proc/\u003cpid\u003e/status, by which time the requesting process may have been replaced by a different process with the same PID that has different privileges then the original requester.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2017-7572` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nbackintime-common - 1.1.2-2~build0.16.04.1\nbackintime-gnome - 1.1.2-2~build0.16.04.1\nbackintime-kde - 1.1.2-2~build0.16.04.1\nbackintime-qt4 - 1.1.2-2~build0.16.04.1\nNo subscription required",
