  "title": "CVE-2017-15105 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - low.",
  "description": "A flaw was found in the way unbound before 1.6.8 validated wildcard-synthesized NSEC records. An improperly validated wildcard NSEC record could be used to prove the non-existence (NXDOMAIN answer) of an existing wildcard record, or trick unbound into accepting a NODATA proof. Ralph Dolmans and Karst Koymans discovered that Unbound did not properly handle certain NSEC records. An attacker could use this to to prove the non-existence (NXDOMAIN answer) of an existing wildcard record, or trick Unbound into accepting a NODATA proof.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2017-15105` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibunbound2 - 1.5.8-1ubuntu1.1\npython-unbound - 1.5.8-1ubuntu1.1\nunbound - 1.5.8-1ubuntu1.1\nunbound-anchor - 1.5.8-1ubuntu1.1\nunbound-host - 1.5.8-1ubuntu1.1\nNo subscription required",
