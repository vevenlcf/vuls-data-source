  "title": "CVE-2017-11126 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - low.",
  "description": "The III_i_stereo function in libmpg123/layer3.c in mpg123 through 1.25.1 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (buffer over-read and application crash) via a crafted audio file that is mishandled in the code for the \"block_type != 2\" case, a similar issue to CVE-2017-9870. It was discovered that mpg123 incorrectly handled certain media files. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or other unspecified impact.",
