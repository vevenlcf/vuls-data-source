  "title": "CVE-2017-3737 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium.",
  "description": "OpenSSL 1.0.2 (starting from version 1.0.2b) introduced an \"error state\" mechanism. The intent was that if a fatal error occurred during a handshake then OpenSSL would move into the error state and would immediately fail if you attempted to continue the handshake. This works as designed for the explicit handshake functions (SSL_do_handshake(), SSL_accept() and SSL_connect()), however due to a bug it does not work correctly if SSL_read() or SSL_write() is called directly. In that scenario, if the handshake fails then a fatal error will be returned in the initial function call. If SSL_read()/SSL_write() is subsequently called by the application for the same SSL object then it will succeed and the data is passed without being decrypted/encrypted directly from the SSL/TLS record layer. In order to exploit this issue an application bug would have to be present that resulted in a call to SSL_read()/SSL_write() being issued after having already received a fatal error. OpenSSL version 1.0.2b-1.0.2m are affected. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2n. OpenSSL 1.1.0 is not affected.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2017-3737` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibssl1.0.0 - 1.0.2g-1ubuntu4.10\nopenssl - 1.0.2g-1ubuntu4.10\nNo subscription required",
