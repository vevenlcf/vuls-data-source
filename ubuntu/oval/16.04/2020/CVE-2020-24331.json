  "description": "An issue was discovered in TrouSerS through 0.3.14. If the tcsd daemon is started with root privileges, the tss user still has read and write access to the /etc/tcsd.conf file (which contains various settings related to this daemon).",
  "note": "mdeslaur\u003e the Debian/Ubuntu package starts tcsd as the tss user, not as root, so this issue doesn't affect default configurations",
