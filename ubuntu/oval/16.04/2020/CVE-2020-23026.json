  "note": "sbeattie\u003e gcc-3.3 only provides libstdc++5 amurray\u003e u-boot and gcc both contain embedded copies of dhrystone rodrigo-zaiden\u003e u-boot is not building with dhrystone in Ubuntu. gcc includes dhrystone in the testsuite, so there is no impact in the usability of gcc and can be ignored.",
