  "title": "CVE-2020-15389 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - low.",
  "description": "jp2/opj_decompress.c in OpenJPEG through 2.3.1 has a use-after-free that can be triggered if there is a mix of valid and invalid files in a directory operated on by the decompressor. Triggering a double-free may also be possible. This is related to calling opj_image_destroy twice. It was discovered that OpenJPEG did not properly handle certain input. If OpenJPEG were supplied with specially crafted input, it could be made to crash or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2020-15389` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibopenjp2-7 - 2.1.2-1.1+deb9u5build0.16.04.1\nlibopenjp2-tools - 2.1.2-1.1+deb9u5build0.16.04.1\nlibopenjp3d-tools - 2.1.2-1.1+deb9u5build0.16.04.1\nlibopenjp3d7 - 2.1.2-1.1+deb9u5build0.16.04.1\nlibopenjpip-dec-server - 2.1.2-1.1+deb9u5build0.16.04.1\nlibopenjpip-server - 2.1.2-1.1+deb9u5build0.16.04.1\nlibopenjpip-viewer - 2.1.2-1.1+deb9u5build0.16.04.1\nlibopenjpip7 - 2.1.2-1.1+deb9u5build0.16.04.1\nNo subscription required",
