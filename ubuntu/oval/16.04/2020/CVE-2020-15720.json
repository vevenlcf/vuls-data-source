  "title": "CVE-2020-15720 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium.",
  "description": "In Dogtag PKI through 10.8.3, the pki.client.PKIConnection class did not enable python-requests certificate validation. Since the verify parameter was hard-coded in all request functions, it was not possible to override the setting. As a result, tools making use of this class, such as the pki-server command, may have been vulnerable to Person-in-the-Middle attacks in certain non-localhost use cases. This is fixed in 10.9.0-b1.",
  "note": "avital\u003e The CVE fix changes the API with the potential to break software which calls dogtag-pki under certain circumstances. If the fix is backported, the freeipa package must also be updated silmitaniously with https://github.com/freeipa/freeipa/pull/4820. Additionally, other packages which use dogtag-pki must be investigated and updated if needed.",
