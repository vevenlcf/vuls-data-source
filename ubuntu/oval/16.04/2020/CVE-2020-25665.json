  "title": "CVE-2020-25665 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - low.",
  "description": "The PALM image coder at coders/palm.c makes an improper call to AcquireQuantumMemory() in routine WritePALMImage() because it needs to be offset by 256. This can cause a out-of-bounds read later on in the routine. The patch adds 256 to bytes_per_row in the call to AcquireQuantumMemory(). This could cause impact to reliability. This flaw affects ImageMagick versions prior to 7.0.8-68.",
