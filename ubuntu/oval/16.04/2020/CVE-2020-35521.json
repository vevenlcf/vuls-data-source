  "title": "CVE-2020-35521 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - negligible.",
  "description": "A flaw was found in libtiff. Due to a memory allocation failure in tif_read.c, a crafted TIFF file can lead to an abort, resulting in denial of service.",
  "note": "ccdm94\u003e various sources, including upstream, seem to indicate that the patch for this issue is the same as the patch for CVE-2020-35522. No patches addressing CVE-2020-35521 specifically were found, and the upstream changelog indicates that commit b5a935d96b is fixing more than one issue, both being most likely closely related. No reproducers or stack traces involving this vulnerability were found, and the issue links (207 and 209) seem to not exist anymore. Therefore, releases that have been patched for CVE-2020-35522 will be considered to have been patched for CVE-2020-35521 as well, as the only sources of information indicate that the patch for both issues is the same.",
