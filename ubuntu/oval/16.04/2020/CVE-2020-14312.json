  "title": "CVE-2020-14312 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium.",
  "description": "A flaw was found in the default configuration of dnsmasq, as shipped with Fedora versions prior to 31 and in all versions Red Hat Enterprise Linux, where it listens on any interface and accepts queries from addresses outside of its local subnet. In particular, the option `local-service` is not enabled. Running dnsmasq in this manner may inadvertently make it an open resolver accessible from any address on the internet. This flaw allows an attacker to conduct a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) against other systems.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2020-14312` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ndnsmasq - 2.75-1ubuntu0.16.04.5\ndnsmasq-base - 2.75-1ubuntu0.16.04.5\ndnsmasq-utils - 2.75-1ubuntu0.16.04.5\nNo subscription required",
