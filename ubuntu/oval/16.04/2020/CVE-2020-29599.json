  "title": "CVE-2020-29599 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - negligible.",
  "description": "ImageMagick before 6.9.11-40 and 7.x before 7.0.10-40 mishandles the -authenticate option, which allows setting a password for password-protected PDF files. The user-controlled password was not properly escaped/sanitized and it was therefore possible to inject additional shell commands via coders/pdf.c.",
