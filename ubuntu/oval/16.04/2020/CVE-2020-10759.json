  "title": "CVE-2020-10759 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium.",
  "description": "A PGP signature bypass flaw was found in fwupd (all versions), which could lead to the installation of unsigned firmware. As per upstream, a signature bypass is theoretically possible, but not practical because the Linux Vendor Firmware Service (LVFS) is either not implemented or enabled in versions of fwupd shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality and integrity.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2020-10759` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nfwupd - 0.8.3-0ubuntu5.1\nlibdfu1 - 0.8.3-0ubuntu5.1\nlibfwupd1 - 0.8.3-0ubuntu5.1\nNo subscription required",
