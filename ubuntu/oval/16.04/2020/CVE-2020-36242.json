  "description": "In the cryptography package before 3.3.2 for Python, certain sequences of update calls to symmetrically encrypt multi-GB values could result in an integer overflow and buffer overflow, as demonstrated by the Fernet class.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2020-36242` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\npython-cryptography - 1.2.3-1ubuntu0.3\npython3-cryptography - 1.2.3-1ubuntu0.3\nNo subscription required",
