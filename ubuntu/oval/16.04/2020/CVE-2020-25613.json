  "title": "CVE-2020-25613 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - low.",
  "description": "An issue was discovered in Ruby through 2.5.8, 2.6.x through 2.6.6, and 2.7.x through 2.7.1. WEBrick, a simple HTTP server bundled with Ruby, had not checked the transfer-encoding header value rigorously. An attacker may potentially exploit this issue to bypass a reverse proxy (which also has a poor header check), which may lead to an HTTP Request Smuggling attack.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2020-25613` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibruby2.3 - 2.3.1-2~ubuntu16.04.15\nruby2.3 - 2.3.1-2~ubuntu16.04.15\nruby2.3-tcltk - 2.3.1-2~ubuntu16.04.15\nNo subscription required",
