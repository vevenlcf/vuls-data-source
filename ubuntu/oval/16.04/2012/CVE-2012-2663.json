  "description": "extensions/libxt_tcp.c in iptables through 1.4.21 does not match TCP SYN+FIN packets in --syn rules, which might allow remote attackers to bypass intended firewall restrictions via crafted packets.  NOTE: the CVE-2012-6638 fix makes this issue less relevant.",
  "note": "sbeattie\u003e This is an iptables userspace issue. A kernel CVE was also assigned as CVE-2012-6638, which has been addressed in Ubuntu kernels. mdeslaur\u003e There is no available fix for this issue for iptables, and changing this would result in an unexpected change in behaviour. We will not be fixing this in Ubuntu stable releases, marking as ignored.",
