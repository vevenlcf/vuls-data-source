  "title": "CVE-2012-4024 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - low.",
  "description": "Stack-based buffer overflow in the get_component function in unsquashfs.c in unsquashfs in Squashfs 4.2 and earlier allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted list file (aka a crafted file for the -ef option).  NOTE: probably in most cases, the list file is a trusted file constructed by the program's user; however, there are some realistic situations in which a list file would be obtained from an untrusted remote source.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2012-4024` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nsquashfs-tools - 1:4.2+20121212-1\nNo subscription required",
