  "description": "curl 7.1.1 to and including 7.75.0 is vulnerable to an \"Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor\" by leaking credentials in the HTTP Referer: header. libcurl does not strip off user credentials from the URL when automatically populating the Referer: HTTP request header field in outgoing HTTP requests, and therefore risks leaking sensitive data to the server that is the target of the second HTTP request.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2021-22876` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ncurl - 7.47.0-1ubuntu2.19\nlibcurl3 - 7.47.0-1ubuntu2.19\nlibcurl3-gnutls - 7.47.0-1ubuntu2.19\nlibcurl3-nss - 7.47.0-1ubuntu2.19\nNo subscription required",
