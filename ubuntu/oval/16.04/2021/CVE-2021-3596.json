  "title": "CVE-2021-3596 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - low.",
  "description": "A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in ImageMagick in versions prior to 7.0.10-31 in ReadSVGImage() in coders/svg.c. This issue is due to not checking the return value from libxml2's xmlCreatePushParserCtxt() and uses the value directly, which leads to a crash and segmentation fault.",
  "note": "amurray\u003e According to debian this only affects imagemagick7 but looking at the code and the patch I suspect the older versions shipped in Ubuntu are also vulnerable.",
