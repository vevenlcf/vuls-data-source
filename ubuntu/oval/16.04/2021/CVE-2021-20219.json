  "description": "A denial of service vulnerability was found in n_tty_receive_char_special in drivers/tty/n_tty.c of the Linux kernel. In this flaw a local attacker with a normal user privilege could delay the loop (due to a changing ldata-\u003eread_head, and a missing sanity check) and cause a threat to the system availability.",
