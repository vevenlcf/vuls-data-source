  "title": "CVE-2021-23986 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium.",
  "description": "A malicious extension with the 'search' permission could have installed a new search engine whose favicon referenced a cross-origin URL. The response to this cross-origin request could have been read by the extension, allowing a same-origin policy bypass by the extension, which should not have cross-origin permissions. This cross-origin request was made without cookies, so the sensitive information disclosed by the violation was limited to local-network resources or resources that perform IP-based authentication. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 87.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2021-23986` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nfirefox - 87.0+build3-0ubuntu0.16.04.2\nfirefox-geckodriver - 87.0+build3-0ubuntu0.16.04.2\nfirefox-mozsymbols - 87.0+build3-0ubuntu0.16.04.2\nNo subscription required",
