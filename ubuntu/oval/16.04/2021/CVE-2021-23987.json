  "description": "Mozilla developers and community members reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 86 and Firefox ESR 78.8. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR \u003c 78.9, Firefox \u003c 87, and Thunderbird \u003c 78.9.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2021-23987` to fix the vulnerability.
