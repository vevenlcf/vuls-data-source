  "title": "CVE-2021-3733 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium.",
  "description": "There's a flaw in urllib's AbstractBasicAuthHandler class. An attacker who controls a malicious HTTP server that an HTTP client (such as web browser) connects to, could trigger a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDOS) during an authentication request with a specially crafted payload that is sent by the server to the client. The greatest threat that this flaw poses is to application availability.",
  "note": "leosilva\u003e code affected in hirsute and devel is already patched, so both releases in python3.9 are not affected.",
