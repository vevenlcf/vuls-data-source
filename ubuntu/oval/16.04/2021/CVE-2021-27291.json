  "title": "CVE-2021-27291 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium.",
  "description": "In pygments 1.1+, fixed in 2.7.4, the lexers used to parse programming languages rely heavily on regular expressions. Some of the regular expressions have exponential or cubic worst-case complexity and are vulnerable to ReDoS. By crafting malicious input, an attacker can cause a denial of service.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2021-27291` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\npython-pygments - 2.1+dfsg-1ubuntu0.2\npython3-pygments - 2.1+dfsg-1ubuntu0.2\nNo subscription required",
