  "title": "CVE-2018-1121 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - low.",
  "description": "procps-ng, procps is vulnerable to a process hiding through race condition. Since the kernel's proc_pid_readdir() returns PID entries in ascending numeric order, a process occupying a high PID can use inotify events to determine when the process list is being scanned, and fork/exec to obtain a lower PID, thus avoiding enumeration. An unprivileged attacker can hide a process from procps-ng's utilities by exploiting a race condition in reading /proc/PID entries. This vulnerability affects procps and procps-ng up to version 3.3.15, newer versions might be affected also.",
  "note": "mdeslaur\u003e this may need to be fixed in the kernel, not in procps tyhicks\u003e As of 2018-10-01, no upstream fix is available.",
