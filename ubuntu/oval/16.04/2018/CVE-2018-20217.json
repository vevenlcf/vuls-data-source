  "title": "CVE-2018-20217 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium.",
  "description": "A Reachable Assertion issue was discovered in the KDC in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) before 1.17. If an attacker can obtain a krbtgt ticket using an older encryption type (single-DES, triple-DES, or RC4), the attacker can crash the KDC by making an S4U2Self request. It was discovered that Kerberos incorrectly handled certain S4U2Self requests. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service.",
