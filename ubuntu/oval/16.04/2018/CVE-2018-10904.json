  "title": "CVE-2018-10904 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium.",
  "description": "It was found that glusterfs server does not properly sanitize file paths in the \"trusted.io-stats-dump\" extended attribute which is used by the \"debug/io-stats\" translator. Attacker can use this flaw to create files and execute arbitrary code. To exploit this attacker would require sufficient access to modify the extended attributes of files on a gluster volume. It was discovered that GlusterFS incorrectly handled file paths. An attacker could possibly use this issue to create arbitrary files and execute arbitrary code.",
