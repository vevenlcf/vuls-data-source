  "title": "CVE-2018-6345 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium.",
  "description": "The function number_format is vulnerable to a heap overflow issue when its second argument ($dec_points) is excessively large. The internal implementation of the function will cause a string to be created with an invalid length, which can then interact poorly with other functions. This affects all supported versions of HHVM (3.30.1 and 3.27.5 and below).",
