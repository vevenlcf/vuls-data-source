  "title": "CVE-2018-12326 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium.",
  "description": "Buffer overflow in redis-cli of Redis before 4.0.10 and 5.x before 5.0 RC3 allows an attacker to achieve code execution and escalate to higher privileges via a crafted command line. NOTE: It is unclear whether there are any common situations in which redis-cli is used with, for example, a -h (aka hostname) argument from an untrusted source. It was discovered that Redis incorrectly handled certain arguments. An attacker could possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2018-12326` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nredis-sentinel - 2:3.0.6-1ubuntu0.2\nredis-server - 2:3.0.6-1ubuntu0.2\nredis-tools - 2:3.0.6-1ubuntu0.2\nNo subscription required",
