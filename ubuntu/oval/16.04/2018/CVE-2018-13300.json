  "description": "In FFmpeg 3.2 and 4.0.1, an improper argument (AVCodecParameters) passed to the avpriv_request_sample function in the handle_eac3 function in libavformat/movenc.c may trigger an out-of-array read while converting a crafted AVI file to MPEG4, leading to a denial of service and possibly an information disclosure.",
  "note": "mdeslaur\u003e marking chromium-browser as ignored, since we do full-version updates, and rely on upstream's bundled ffmpeg version ebarretto\u003e ffmpeg 2.8 has a subtle difference in the code that make it not affected.",
