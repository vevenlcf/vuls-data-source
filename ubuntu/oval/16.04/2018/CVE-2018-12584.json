  "title": "CVE-2018-12584 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium.",
  "description": "The ConnectionBase::preparseNewBytes function in resip/stack/ConnectionBase.cxx in reSIProcate through 1.10.2 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (buffer overflow) or possibly execute arbitrary code when TLS communication is enabled. It was discovered that reSIProcate incorrectly handled SIP message bodies. A remote attacker could exploit this with a crafted SIP message to cause reSIProcate to crash, resulting in a denial of service (buffer overflow).",
