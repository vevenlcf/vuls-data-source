  "description": "Division-by-zero vulnerabilities in the functions pi_next_pcrl, pi_next_cprl, and pi_next_rpcl in openmj2/pi.c in OpenJPEG through 2.3.0 allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash). It was discovered that OpenJPEG incorrectly handled certain image files. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service.",
  "note": "ebarretto\u003e Marking emscripten ignored as openjpeg2 code is only for test/example. mdeslaur\u003e Ubuntu openjpeg2 packages are built with BUILD_MJ2:BOOL=OFF, so the vulnerable code is not compiled",
