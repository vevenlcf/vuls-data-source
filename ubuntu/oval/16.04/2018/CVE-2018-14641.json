  "title": "CVE-2018-14641 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - high.",
  "description": "A security flaw was found in the ip_frag_reasm() function in net/ipv4/ip_fragment.c in the Linux kernel from 4.19-rc1 to 4.19-rc3 inclusive, which can cause a later system crash in ip_do_fragment(). With certain non-default, but non-rare, configuration of a victim host, an attacker can trigger this crash remotely, thus leading to a remote denial-of-service.",
  "note": "sbeattie\u003e this vulnerability is a result of the fix for CVE-2018-5391/FragmentSmack; however, an alternative fix for CVE-2018-5391 was to revert c2a936600f78aea00d3312ea4b66a79a4619f9b4, which is what the Ubuntu kernels used.",
