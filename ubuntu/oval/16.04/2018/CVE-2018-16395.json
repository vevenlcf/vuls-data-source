  "title": "CVE-2018-16395 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium.",
  "description": "An issue was discovered in the OpenSSL library in Ruby before 2.3.8, 2.4.x before 2.4.5, 2.5.x before 2.5.2, and 2.6.x before 2.6.0-preview3. When two OpenSSL::X509::Name objects are compared using ==, depending on the ordering, non-equal objects may return true. When the first argument is one character longer than the second, or the second argument contains a character that is one less than a character in the same position of the first argument, the result of == will be true. This could be leveraged to create an illegitimate certificate that may be accepted as legitimate and then used in signing or encryption operations.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2018-16395` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibruby2.3 - 2.3.1-2~16.04.11\nruby2.3 - 2.3.1-2~16.04.11\nruby2.3-tcltk - 2.3.1-2~16.04.11\nNo subscription required",
