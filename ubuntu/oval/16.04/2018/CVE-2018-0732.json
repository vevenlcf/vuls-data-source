  "title": "CVE-2018-0732 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - low.",
  "description": "During key agreement in a TLS handshake using a DH(E) based ciphersuite a malicious server can send a very large prime value to the client. This will cause the client to spend an unreasonably long period of time generating a key for this prime resulting in a hang until the client has finished. This could be exploited in a Denial Of Service attack. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.0i-dev (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0h). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2p-dev (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2o).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2018-0732` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibssl1.0.0 - 1.0.2g-1ubuntu4.13\nopenssl - 1.0.2g-1ubuntu4.13\nNo subscription required",
