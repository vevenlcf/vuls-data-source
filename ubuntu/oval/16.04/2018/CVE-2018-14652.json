  "title": "CVE-2018-14652 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium.",
  "description": "The Gluster file system through versions 3.12 and 4.1.4 is vulnerable to a buffer overflow in the 'features/index' translator via the code handling the 'GF_XATTR_CLRLK_CMD' xattr in the 'pl_getxattr' function. A remote authenticated attacker could exploit this on a mounted volume to cause a denial of service. It was discovered that GlusterFS incorrectly handled certain files. A remote authenticated attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service.",
