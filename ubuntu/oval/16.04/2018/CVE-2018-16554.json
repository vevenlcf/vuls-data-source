  "title": "CVE-2018-16554 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - low.",
  "description": "The ProcessGpsInfo function of the gpsinfo.c file of jhead 3.00 may allow a remote attacker to cause a denial-of-service attack or unspecified other impact via a malicious JPEG file, because of inconsistency between float and double in a sprintf format string during TAG_GPS_ALT handling. It was discovered that jhead did not properly handle certain crafted input. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious JPEG file, a remote attacker could cause jhead to crash.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2018-16554` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\njhead - 1:3.00-8+deb9u1build.16.04.1\nNo subscription required",
