  "title": "CVE-2018-7749 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - high.",
  "description": "The SSH server implementation of AsyncSSH before 1.12.1 does not properly check whether authentication is completed before processing other requests. A customized SSH client can simply skip the authentication step. Matthijs Kooijman discovered that AsyncSSH server did not properly handle authentication under certain conditions. An attacker with a specially crafted client could use this vulnerability to skip authentication of SSH sessions.",
