  "description": "The seunshare_mount function in sandbox/seunshare.c in seunshare in certain Red Hat packages of policycoreutils 2.0.83 and earlier in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 6 and earlier, and Fedora 14 and earlier, mounts a new directory on top of /tmp without assigning root ownership and the sticky bit to this new directory, which allows local users to replace or delete arbitrary /tmp files, and consequently cause a denial of service or possibly gain privileges, by running a setuid application that relies on /tmp, as demonstrated by the ksu application.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2011-1011` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\npolicycoreutils - 2.2.5-1\npython-sepolicy - 2.2.5-1\nNo subscription required",
