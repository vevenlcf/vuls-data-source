  "title": "CVE-2022-25265 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - negligible.",
  "description": "In the Linux kernel through 5.16.10, certain binary files may have the exec-all attribute if they were built in approximately 2003 (e.g., with GCC 3.2.2 and Linux kernel 2.4.20). This can cause execution of bytes located in supposedly non-executable regions of a file.",
  "note": "sbeattie\u003e this is in place so that ancient binaries will continue to work; if an attacker can link a modern binary to allow this, they could just create and execute a binary. need to validate that we don't ever ship binaries without GNU_PT_STACK",
