  "description": "A flaw null pointer dereference in the Linux kernel UDF file system functionality was found in the way user triggers udf_file_write_iter function for the malicious UDF image. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system. Actual from Linux kernel 4.2-rc1 till 5.17-rc2. It was discovered that the UDF file system implementation in the Linux kernel could attempt to dereference a null pointer in some situations. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious UDF image that, when mounted and operated on, could cause a denial of service (system crash).",
