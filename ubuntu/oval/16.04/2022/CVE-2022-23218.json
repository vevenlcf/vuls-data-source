  "title": "CVE-2022-23218 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - low.",
  "description": "The deprecated compatibility function svcunix_create in the sunrpc module of the GNU C Library (aka glibc) through 2.34 copies its path argument on the stack without validating its length, which may result in a buffer overflow, potentially resulting in a denial of service or (if an application is not built with a stack protector enabled) arbitrary code execution.",
  "note": "mdeslaur\u003e Ubuntu has stack protector enabled since 2006, so this issue is only a denial of service.",
