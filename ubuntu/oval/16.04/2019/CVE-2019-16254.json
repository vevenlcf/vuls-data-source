  "title": "CVE-2019-16254 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium.",
  "description": "Ruby through 2.4.7, 2.5.x through 2.5.6, and 2.6.x through 2.6.4 allows HTTP Response Splitting. If a program using WEBrick inserts untrusted input into the response header, an attacker can exploit it to insert a newline character to split a header, and inject malicious content to deceive clients. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2017-17742, which addressed the CRLF vector, but did not address an isolated CR or an isolated LF. It was discovered that JRuby mishandled newline characters in HTTP response headers. A remote attacker could use this vulnerability to display malicious content to HTTP clients.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2019-16254` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibruby2.3 - 2.3.1-2~ubuntu16.04.14\nruby2.3 - 2.3.1-2~ubuntu16.04.14\nruby2.3-tcltk - 2.3.1-2~ubuntu16.04.14\nNo subscription required",
