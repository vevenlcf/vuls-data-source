  "description": "Legacy C++ Facebook Thrift servers (using cpp instead of cpp2) would not error upon receiving messages with containers of fields of unknown type. As a result, malicious clients could send short messages which would take a long time for the server to parse, potentially leading to denial of service. This issue affects Facebook Thrift prior to v2019.05.06.00.",
