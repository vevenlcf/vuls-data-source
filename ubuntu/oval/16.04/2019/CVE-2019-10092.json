  "description": "In Apache HTTP Server 2.4.0-2.4.39, a limited cross-site scripting issue was reported affecting the mod_proxy error page. An attacker could cause the link on the error page to be malformed and instead point to a page of their choice. This would only be exploitable where a server was set up with proxying enabled but was misconfigured in such a way that the Proxy Error page was displayed.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2019-10092` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\napache2 - 2.4.18-2ubuntu3.12\napache2-bin - 2.4.18-2ubuntu3.12\napache2-data - 2.4.18-2ubuntu3.12\napache2-suexec-custom - 2.4.18-2ubuntu3.12\napache2-suexec-pristine - 2.4.18-2ubuntu3.12\napache2-utils - 2.4.18-2ubuntu3.12\nNo subscription required",
