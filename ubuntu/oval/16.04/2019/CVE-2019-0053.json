  "description": "Insufficient validation of environment variables in the telnet client supplied in Junos OS can lead to stack-based buffer overflows, which can be exploited to bypass veriexec restrictions on Junos OS. A stack-based overflow is present in the handling of environment variables when connecting via the telnet client to remote telnet servers. This issue only affects the telnet client — accessible from the CLI or shell — in Junos OS. Inbound telnet services are not affected by this issue.
