  "title": "CVE-2019-16230 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - negligible.",
  "description": "** DISPUTED ** drivers/gpu/drm/radeon/radeon_display.c in the Linux kernel 5.2.14 does not check the alloc_workqueue return value, leading to a NULL pointer dereference. NOTE: A third-party software maintainer states that the work queue allocation is happening during device initialization, which for a graphics card occurs during boot. It is not attacker controllable and OOM at that time is highly unlikely. It was discovered that the Radeon Linux kernel driver for AMD GPU devices did not properly check for errors in certain situations, leading to a NULL pointer dereference. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service.",
  "note": "sbeattie\u003e as of 2022-01-27, still unfixed upstream, mistakenly believed to be addressed by the fix for CVE-2019-16229 it's possible this was introduced in a37cfa8be20c5571ca82fac38441592040a2d071 issue can only occur on device initialization, which is usually during boot and not attacker controllable sbeattie\u003e the linux-kernel-tracker lists 81de29d842ccb776c0f77aa3e2b11b07fff0c0e2 as the fix, but that is actually the fix for CVE-2019-16229",
