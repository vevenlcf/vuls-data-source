  "title": "CVE-2019-18634 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - low.",
  "description": "In Sudo before 1.8.26, if pwfeedback is enabled in /etc/sudoers, users can trigger a stack-based buffer overflow in the privileged sudo process. (pwfeedback is a default setting in Linux Mint and elementary OS; however, it is NOT the default for upstream and many other packages, and would exist only if enabled by an administrator.) The attacker needs to deliver a long string to the stdin of getln() in tgetpass.c.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2019-18634` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nsudo - 1.8.16-0ubuntu1.9\nsudo-ldap - 1.8.16-0ubuntu1.9\nNo subscription required",
