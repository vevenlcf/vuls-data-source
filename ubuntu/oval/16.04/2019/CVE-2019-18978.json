  "title": "CVE-2019-18978 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium.",
  "description": "An issue was discovered in the rack-cors (aka Rack CORS Middleware) gem before 1.0.4 for Ruby. It allows ../ directory traversal to access private resources because resource matching does not ensure that pathnames are in a canonical format. It was discovered that rack-cors did not properly handle relative file paths. An attacker could use this vulnerability to access arbitrary files.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2019-18978` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nruby-rack-cors - 0.4.0-1+deb9u2build0.16.04.1\nNo subscription required",
