  "description": "In clearFilter() in utilities.php in Cacti before 1.2.3, no escaping occurs before printing out the value of the SNMP community string (SNMP Options) in the View poller cache, leading to XSS. It was discovered that Cacti doesn't properly handles the value of some SNMP Options strings. An attacker could use it to do XSS and cause a Denial of Service or code execution.",
