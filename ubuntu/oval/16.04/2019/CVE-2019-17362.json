  "title": "CVE-2019-17362 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium.",
  "description": "In LibTomCrypt through 1.18.2, the der_decode_utf8_string function (in der_decode_utf8_string.c) does not properly detect certain invalid UTF-8 sequences. This allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and crash) or read information from other memory locations via carefully crafted DER-encoded data. It was discovered that LibTomCrypt incorrectly handled certain inputs. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or read sensitive information.",
