  "title": "CVE-2019-13050 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - low.",
  "description": "Interaction between the sks-keyserver code through 1.2.0 of the SKS keyserver network, and GnuPG through 2.2.16, makes it risky to have a GnuPG keyserver configuration line referring to a host on the SKS keyserver network. Retrieving data from this network may cause a persistent denial of service, because of a Certificate Spamming Attack.",
  "note": "mdeslaur\u003e this is a weakness in the PGP keyserver design. amurray\u003e gnupg upstream has 2 mitigations for this - firstly, don't import key signatures by default anymore, and to fallback to only import self-signatures on very large keyblocks mdeslaur\u003e as of 2020-01-06, there is no ideal fix for this issue marking this CVE as deferred until a complete fix is available sbeattie\u003e gnupg mitigations landed in upstream in 2.2.17 with important fixes in 2.2.18 2.2.19-3ubuntu1 introduced a debian/ubuntu specific change to use keys.openpgp.org as the default keyserver any backports to address this issue will be complex and introduce changes in behavior sks in debian introduced very basic filtering in 1.1.6+git20210302.c3ba6d5a-1 rodrigo-zaiden\u003e as of 2022-03-22, there is no upstream backport for gnupg 1.4 series. Backporting from 2.2 is too risky.",
