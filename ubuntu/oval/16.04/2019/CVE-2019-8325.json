  "title": "CVE-2019-8325 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium.",
  "description": "An issue was discovered in RubyGems 2.6 and later through 3.0.2. Since Gem::CommandManager#run calls alert_error without escaping, escape sequence injection is possible. (There are many ways to cause an error.) It was discovered that Gem::CommandMangert#run failed to escape certain characters. An attacker could use this vulnerability inject escape sequences into a victim's terminal.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2019-8325` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibruby2.3 - 2.3.1-2~16.04.12\nruby2.3 - 2.3.1-2~16.04.12\nruby2.3-tcltk - 2.3.1-2~16.04.12\nNo subscription required",
