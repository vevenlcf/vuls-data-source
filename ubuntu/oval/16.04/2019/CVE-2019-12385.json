The search engine is affected by a SQL Injection, so any user able to perform lib/class/search.class.php searches (even guest users) can dump any data contained in the database (sessions, hashed passwords, etc.). This may lead to a full compromise of admin accounts, when combined with the weak password generator algorithm used in the lostpassword functionality.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2019-12385` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nampache - 3.6-rzb2779+dfsg-0ubuntu9.2\nampache-common - 3.6-rzb2779+dfsg-0ubuntu9.2\nNo subscription required",
