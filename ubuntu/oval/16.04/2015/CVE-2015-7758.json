  "title": "CVE-2015-7758 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - low.",
  "description": "Gummi 0.6.5 allows local users to write to arbitrary files via a symlink attack on a temporary dot file that uses the name of an existing file and a (1) .aux, (2) .log, (3) .out, (4) .pdf, or (5) .toc extension for the file name, as demonstrated by .thesis.tex.aux. It was discovered that Gummi created unsafe, predictable filenames in /tmp, resulting in a race condition. An attacker could use this vulnerability to overwrite arbitrary files.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2015-7758` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ngummi - 0.6.6-1\nNo subscription required",
