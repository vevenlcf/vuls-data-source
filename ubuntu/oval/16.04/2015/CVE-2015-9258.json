  "description": "In Docker Notary before 0.1, gotuf/signed/verify.go has a Signature Algorithm Not Matched to Key vulnerability. Because an attacker controls the field specifying the signature algorithm, they might (for example) be able to forge a signature by forcing a misinterpretation of an RSA-PSS key as Ed25519 elliptic-curve data.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2015-9258` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nnotary - 0.1~ds1-1\nNo subscription required",
