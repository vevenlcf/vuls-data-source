  "title": "CVE-2015-8978 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - low.",
  "description": "In Soap Lite (aka the SOAP::Lite extension for Perl) 1.14 and earlier, an example attack consists of defining 10 or more XML entities, each defined as consisting of 10 of the previous entity, with the document consisting of a single instance of the largest entity, which expands to one billion copies of the first entity. The amount of computer memory used for handling an external SOAP call would likely exceed that available to the process parsing the XML.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2015-8978` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibsoap-lite-perl - 1.19-1\nNo subscription required",
