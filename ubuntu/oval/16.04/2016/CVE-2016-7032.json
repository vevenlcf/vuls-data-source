  "description": "sudo_noexec.so in Sudo before 1.8.15 on Linux might allow local users to bypass intended noexec command restrictions via an application that calls the (1) system or (2) popen function.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2016-7032` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nsudo - 1.8.16-0ubuntu1.2\nsudo-ldap - 1.8.16-0ubuntu1.2\nNo subscription required",
  "note": "seth-arnold\u003e I'm marking this negligible because this feature seems doomed to failure in the general case. Any sort of memory-protection flaws in the target process, or ability to execute system calls directly, or programs that don't use the standard C libraries, etc. won't be affected by this feature. If you rely upon this feature I suggest instead seccomp2-based filters to disable the execve() and execveat() system calls at the kernel interface or AppArmor (or other MAC system) to restrict which executables can be executed.",
