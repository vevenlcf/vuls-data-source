The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nntp - 1:4.2.8p4+dfsg-3ubuntu5.5\nntpdate - 1:4.2.8p4+dfsg-3ubuntu5.5\nNo subscription required",

But the root-distance calculation in general is incorrect in all versions of ntp-4 until this release. leosilva\u003e for precise it's not needed since this issue seems to be caused by some regression and precise hasn't the code affect changed. mdeslaur\u003e trusty isn't vulnerable either",
