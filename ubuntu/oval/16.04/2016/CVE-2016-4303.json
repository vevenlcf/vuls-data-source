  "title": "CVE-2016-4303 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium.",
  "description": "The parse_string function in cjson.c in the cJSON library mishandles UTF8/16 strings, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or execute arbitrary code via a non-hex character in a JSON string, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow. It was discovered that iperf mishandled certain UTF8 and UTF16 strings. A remote attacker could use this vulnerability to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
