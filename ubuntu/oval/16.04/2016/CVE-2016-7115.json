  "description": "Buffer overflow in the handle_packet function in mactelnet.c in the client in MAC-Telnet 0.4.3 and earlier allows remote TELNET servers to execute arbitrary code via a long string in an MT_CPTYPE_PASSSALT control packet. It was discovered that mactelnet mishandled certain input. If a victim were tricked into connecting to a malicious telnet server, a remote, unauthenticated attacker could execute arbitrary code.",
