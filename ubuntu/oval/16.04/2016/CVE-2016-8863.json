  "description": "Heap-based buffer overflow in the create_url_list function in gena/gena_device.c in Portable UPnP SDK (aka libupnp) before 1.6.21 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a valid URI followed by an invalid one in the CALLBACK header of an SUBSCRIBE request. It was discovered that libupnp mishandled certain input. A remote attacker could use this vulnerability to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
