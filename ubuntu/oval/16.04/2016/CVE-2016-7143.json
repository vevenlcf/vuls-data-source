  "title": "CVE-2016-7143 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium.",
  "description": "The m_authenticate function in modules/m_sasl.c in Charybdis before 3.5.3 allows remote attackers to spoof certificate fingerprints and consequently log in as another user via a crafted AUTHENTICATE parameter. It was discovered that Charybdis incorrectly handled AUTHENTICATE parameters. An attacker could possibly use this issue to log in as another user.",
