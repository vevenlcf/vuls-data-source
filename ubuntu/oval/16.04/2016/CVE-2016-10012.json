  "title": "CVE-2016-10012 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - low.",
  "description": "The shared memory manager (associated with pre-authentication compression) in sshd in OpenSSH before 7.4 does not ensure that a bounds check is enforced by all compilers, which might allows local users to gain privileges by leveraging access to a sandboxed privilege-separation process, related to the m_zback and m_zlib data structures.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2016-10012` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nopenssh-client - 1:7.2p2-4ubuntu2.4\nopenssh-client-ssh1 - 1:7.2p2-4ubuntu2.4\nopenssh-server - 1:7.2p2-4ubuntu2.4\nopenssh-sftp-server - 1:7.2p2-4ubuntu2.4\nssh - 1:7.2p2-4ubuntu2.4\nssh-askpass-gnome - 1:7.2p2-4ubuntu2.4\nssh-krb5 - 1:7.2p2-4ubuntu2.4\nNo subscription required",
  "note": "ratliff\u003e Mitigating circumstances noted in the release notes: This could potentially allow attacks against the privileged monitor process from the sandboxed privilege-separation process (a compromise of the latter would be required first). also \"pre-auth compression has been disabled by default in sshd for \u003e10 years.\"",
