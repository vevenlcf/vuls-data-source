  "description": "Use-after-free vulnerability in validators/DTD/DTDScanner.cpp in Apache Xerces C++ 3.1.3 and earlier allows context-dependent attackers to have unspecified impact via an invalid character in an XML document. It was discovered that Xerces-C XML Parser mishandles certain kinds of external DTD references, resulting in a user-after-free. An attacker could use this vulnerability to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
