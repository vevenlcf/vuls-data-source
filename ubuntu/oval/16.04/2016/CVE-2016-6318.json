  "description": "Stack-based buffer overflow in the FascistGecosUser function in lib/fascist.c in cracklib allows local users to cause a denial of service (application crash) or gain privileges via a long GECOS field, involving longbuffer.",
  "note": "tyhicks\u003e Ubuntu's chfn limits the total GECOS field length to 84 characters which is well within cracklib2's buffer size of 2048. libpam-cracklib is not part of the default install so PAM cracklib support is not enabled in the majority of Ubuntu installs Ubuntu's /etc/login.defs only allows unprivileged users to set their room number, work phone, and home phone",
