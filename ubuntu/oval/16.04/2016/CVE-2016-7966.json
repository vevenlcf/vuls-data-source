  "description": "Through a malicious URL that contained a quote character it was possible to inject HTML code in KMail's plaintext viewer. Due to the parser used on the URL it was not possible to include the equal sign (=) or a space into the injected HTML, which greatly reduces the available HTML functionality. Although it is possible to include an HTML comment indicator to hide content.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2016-7966` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibkf5coreaddons-data - 5.18.0-0ubuntu1.1\nlibkf5coreaddons5 - 5.18.0-0ubuntu1.1\nNo subscription required",
  "note": "mdeslaur\u003e per ScottK: Affected package is kdepimlibs in 12.04 - 15.04 and it looks like both kcoreaddons and messagecomposer in later releases tsimonq2\u003e An additional part to this was released, therefore we need additional commits on top of the initial fix.",
