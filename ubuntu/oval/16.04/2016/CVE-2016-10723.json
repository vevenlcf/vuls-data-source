  "title": "CVE-2016-10723 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - low.",
  "description": "** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 4.17.2. Since the page allocator does not yield CPU resources to the owner of the oom_lock mutex, a local unprivileged user can trivially lock up the system forever by wasting CPU resources from the page allocator (e.g., via concurrent page fault events) when the global OOM killer is invoked. NOTE: the software maintainer has not accepted certain proposed patches, in part because of a viewpoint that \"the underlying problem is non-trivial to handle.\"",
  "note": "tyhicks\u003e 9bfe5ded054b8e28a94c78580f233d6879a00146 may be an incomplete fix; see the lore.kernel.org references above As of 2019-01-24, we're deferring this issue since there's not a complete, low risk fix available",
