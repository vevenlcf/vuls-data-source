  "title": "CVE-2016-4074 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial) - medium.",
  "description": "The jv_dump_term function in jq 1.5 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (stack consumption and application crash) via a crafted JSON file. This issue has been fixed in jq 1.6_rc1-r0. It was discovered that jq did not perform sufficient bounds checking, resulting in unbounded resource consumption. An attacker could use this vulnerability to cause a denial of service.",
