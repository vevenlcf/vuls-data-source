  "description": "Minimatch is a minimal matching utility that works by converting glob expressions into JavaScript `RegExp` objects. The primary function, `minimatch(path, pattern)` in Minimatch 3.0.1 and earlier is vulnerable to ReDoS in the `pattern` parameter. It was discovered that Minimatch did not perform necessary bounds checking on regular expressions. An attacker could use this vulnerability to cause a denial of service.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2016-10540` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nnode-minimatch - 3.0.4-3\nNo subscription required",
