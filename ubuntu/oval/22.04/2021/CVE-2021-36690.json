  "description": "** DISPUTED ** A segmentation fault can occur in the sqlite3.exe command-line component of SQLite 3.36.0 via the idxGetTableInfo function when there is a crafted SQL query. NOTE: the vendor disputes the relevance of this report because a sqlite3.exe user already has full privileges (e.g., is intentionally allowed to execute commands). This report does NOT imply any problem in the SQLite library.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2021-36690` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlemon - 3.36.0-2\nlibsqlite3-0 - 3.36.0-2\nlibsqlite3-tcl - 3.36.0-2\nsqlite3 - 3.36.0-2\nsqlite3-tools - 3.36.0-2\nNo subscription required",
