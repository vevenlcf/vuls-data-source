  "title": "CVE-2021-32791 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (jammy) - low.",
  "description": "mod_auth_openidc is an authentication/authorization module for the Apache 2.x HTTP server that functions as an OpenID Connect Relying Party, authenticating users against an OpenID Connect Provider. In mod_auth_openidc before version 2.4.9, the AES GCM encryption in mod_auth_openidc uses a static IV and AAD. It is important to fix because this creates a static nonce and since aes-gcm is a stream cipher, this can lead to known cryptographic issues, since the same key is being reused. From 2.4.9 onwards this has been patched to use dynamic values through usage of cjose AES encryption routines.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2021-32791` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibapache2-mod-auth-openidc - 2.4.9-1\nNo subscription required",
