  "title": "CVE-2021-4122 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (jammy) - medium.",
  "description": "It was found that a specially crafted LUKS header could trick cryptsetup into disabling encryption during the recovery of the device. An attacker with physical access to the medium, such as a flash disk, could use this flaw to force a user into permanently disabling the encryption layer of that medium.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2021-4122` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ncryptsetup - 2:2.4.3-1ubuntu1\ncryptsetup-bin - 2:2.4.3-1ubuntu1\ncryptsetup-initramfs - 2:2.4.3-1ubuntu1\ncryptsetup-run - 2:2.4.3-1ubuntu1\ncryptsetup-suspend - 2:2.4.3-1ubuntu1\nlibcryptsetup12 - 2:2.4.3-1ubuntu1\nNo subscription required",
  "note": "amurray\u003e Vulnerability is in the online re-encryption feature which is only supported by cryptsetup \u003e= 2.2.0 mdeslaur\u003e per upstream, the backport to 2.2 would be very problematic and it is suggested that the best option is to disable online reencryption",
