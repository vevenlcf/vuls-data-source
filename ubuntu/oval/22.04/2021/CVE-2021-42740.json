  "title": "CVE-2021-42740 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (jammy) - medium.",
  "description": "The shell-quote package before 1.7.3 for Node.js allows command injection. An attacker can inject unescaped shell metacharacters through a regex designed to support Windows drive letters. If the output of this package is passed to a real shell as a quoted argument to a command with exec(), an attacker can inject arbitrary commands. This is because the Windows drive letter regex character class is {A-z] instead of the correct {A-Za-z]. Several shell metacharacters exist in the space between capital letter Z and lower case letter a, such as the backtick character.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2021-42740` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nnode-shell-quote - 1.7.3+~1.7.1-1\nNo subscription required",
