  "description": "A flaw was found in ansible-runner. An improper escaping of the shell command, while calling the ansible_runner.interface.run_command, can lead to parameters getting executed as host's shell command. A developer could unintentionally write code that gets executed in the host rather than the virtual environment.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2021-4041` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\npython3-ansible-runner - 2.1.1-1\nNo subscription required",
