  "title": "CVE-2021-45098 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (jammy) - medium.",
  "description": "An issue was discovered in Suricata before 6.0.4. It is possible to bypass/evade any HTTP-based signature by faking an RST TCP packet with random TCP options of the md5header from the client side. After the three-way handshake, it's possible to inject an RST ACK with a random TCP md5header option. Then, the client can send an HTTP GET request with a forbidden URL. The server will ignore the RST ACK and send the response HTTP packet for the client's request. These packets will not trigger a Suricata reject action.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2021-45098` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nsuricata - 1:6.0.4-3\nNo subscription required",
