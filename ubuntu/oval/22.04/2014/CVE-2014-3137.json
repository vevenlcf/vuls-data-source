  "title": "CVE-2014-3137 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (jammy) - medium.",
  "description": "Bottle 0.10.x before 0.10.12, 0.11.x before 0.11.7, and 0.12.x before 0.12.6 does not properly limit content types, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions via an accepted Content-Type followed by a ; (semi-colon) and a Content-Type that would not be accepted, as demonstrated in YouCompleteMe to execute arbitrary code. It was discovered that Bottle does not properly limit content types. A remote attacker could possibly use this to execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2014-3137` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\npython3-bottle - 0.12.6-1\nNo subscription required",
