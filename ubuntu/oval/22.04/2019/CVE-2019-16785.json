  "title": "CVE-2019-16785 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (jammy) - low.",
  "description": "Waitress through version 1.3.1 implemented a \"MAY\" part of the RFC7230 which states: \"Although the line terminator for the start-line and header fields is the sequence CRLF, a recipient MAY recognize a single LF as a line terminator and ignore any preceding CR.\" Unfortunately if a front-end server does not parse header fields with an LF the same way as it does those with a CRLF it can lead to the front-end and the back-end server parsing the same HTTP message in two different ways. This can lead to a potential for HTTP request smuggling/splitting whereby Waitress may see two requests while the front-end server only sees a single HTTP message. This issue is fixed in Waitress 1.4.0.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2019-16785` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\npython3-waitress - 1.4.1-1\nNo subscription required",
