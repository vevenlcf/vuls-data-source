  "description": "A NULL pointer dereference was discovered in ifilter_bank of libfaad/filtbank.c in Freeware Advanced Audio Decoder 2 (FAAD2) 2.8.8. The vulnerability causes a segmentation fault and application crash because adding to windowed output is mishandled in the EIGHT_SHORT_SEQUENCE case.
