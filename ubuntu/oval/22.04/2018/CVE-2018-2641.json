  "title": "CVE-2018-2641 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (jammy) - medium.",
  "description": "Vulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded component of Oracle Java SE (subcomponent: AWT). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 6u171, 7u161, 8u152 and 9.0.1; Java SE Embedded: 8u151. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Java SE, Java SE Embedded, attacks may significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized creation, deletion or modification access to critical data or all Java SE, Java SE Embedded accessible data. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an administrator). CVSS 3.0 Base Score 6.1 (Integrity impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N). It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the AWT component of OpenJDK when loading the GTK library. An attacker could possibly use this to execute arbitrary code and escape Java sandbox restrictions.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2018-2641` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nopenjdk-8-demo - 8u162-b12-1\nopenjdk-8-jdk - 8u162-b12-1\nopenjdk-8-jdk-headless - 8u162-b12-1\nopenjdk-8-jre - 8u162-b12-1\nopenjdk-8-jre-headless - 8u162-b12-1\nopenjdk-8-jre-zero - 8u162-b12-1\nopenjdk-8-source - 8u162-b12-1\nNo subscription required",
