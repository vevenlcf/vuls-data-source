  "title": "CVE-2018-12886 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (jammy) - low.",
  "description": "stack_protect_prologue in cfgexpand.c and stack_protect_epilogue in function.c in GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) 4.1 through 8 (under certain circumstances) generate instruction sequences when targeting ARM targets that spill the address of the stack protector guard, which allows an attacker to bypass the protection of -fstack-protector, -fstack-protector-all, -fstack-protector-strong, and -fstack-protector-explicit against stack overflow by controlling what the stack canary is compared against.",
  "note": "mdeslaur\u003e Upstream has fixed this in GCC9 only as of 2019-05-30. 32-bit ARM only, risky backport, and would require archive rebuild. Setting priority as low for now, we may decide this issue is not worth fixing in stable releases.",
