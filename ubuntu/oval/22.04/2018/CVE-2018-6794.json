  "title": "CVE-2018-6794 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (jammy) - medium.",
  "description": "Suricata before 4.0.4 is prone to an HTTP detection bypass vulnerability in detect.c and stream-tcp.c. If a malicious server breaks a normal TCP flow and sends data before the 3-way handshake is complete, then the data sent by the malicious server will be accepted by web clients such as a web browser or Linux CLI utilities, but ignored by Suricata IDS signatures. This mostly affects IDS signatures for the HTTP protocol and TCP stream content; signatures for TCP packets will inspect such network traffic as usual.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2018-6794` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nsuricata - 1:4.0.5-1\nNo subscription required",
