  "description": "FasterXML jackson-databind 2.x before 2.9.8 might allow attackers to have unspecified impact by leveraging failure to block the axis2-transport-jms class from polymorphic deserialization. It was discovered that Jackson Databind incorrectly handled deserialization. An attacker could possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary code or other unspecified impact.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2018-19360` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibjackson2-databind-java - 2.9.8-1\nNo subscription required",
