  "description": "It was found that the fix for CVE-2016-9606 in versions 3.0.22 and 3.1.2 was incomplete and Yaml unmarshalling in Resteasy is still possible via `Yaml.load()` in YamlProvider.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2018-1051` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibresteasy-java - 3.6.2-2\nNo subscription required\n\nlibresteasy3.0-java - 3.0.26-1\nNo subscription required",
  "note": "msalvatore\u003e Incomplete fix for CVE-2016-9606 not applied. That fix just disables the YamlProvider by default. There is no fix for this issue other than to mitigate it by requiring authentication and authorization on endpoints expecting YAML input.",
