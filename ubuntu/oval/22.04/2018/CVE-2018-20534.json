  "description": "** DISPUTED ** There is an illegal address access at ext/testcase.c in libsolv.a in libsolv through 0.7.2 that will cause a denial of service. NOTE: third parties dispute this issue stating that the issue affects the test suite and not the underlying library. It cannot be exploited in any real-world application. It was discovered that libsolv incorrectly handled certain malformed input. An attacker could use this issue to cause libsolv to crash, resulting in a denial of service.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2018-20534` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibsolv-perl - 0.6.5-2ubuntu1\nlibsolv-tools - 0.6.5-2ubuntu1\nlibsolv1 - 0.6.5-2ubuntu1\nlibsolvext1 - 0.6.5-2ubuntu1\npython3-solv - 0.6.5-2ubuntu1\nNo subscription required",
