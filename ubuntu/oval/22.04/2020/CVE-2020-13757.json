  "title": "CVE-2020-13757 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (jammy) - medium.",
  "description": "Python-RSA before 4.1 ignores leading '\\0' bytes during decryption of ciphertext. This could conceivably have a security-relevant impact, e.g., by helping an attacker to infer that an application uses Python-RSA, or if the length of accepted ciphertext affects application behavior (such as by causing excessive memory allocation).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2020-13757` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\npython3-rsa - 4.8-1\nNo subscription required",
