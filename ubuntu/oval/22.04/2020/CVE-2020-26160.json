  "title": "CVE-2020-26160 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (jammy) - medium.",
  "description": "jwt-go before 4.0.0-preview1 allows attackers to bypass intended access restrictions in situations with []string{} for m[\"aud\"] (which is allowed by the specification). Because the type assertion fails, \"\" is the value of aud. This is a security problem if the JWT token is presented to a service that lacks its own audience check.",
  "note": "mdeslaur\u003e as of 2020-10-02, the proposed patches have not been accepted into the upstream tree.  juju-core doesn't use jwt-go in a way that exposes the vulnerability",
