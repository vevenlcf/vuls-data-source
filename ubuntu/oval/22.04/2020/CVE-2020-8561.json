  "title": "CVE-2020-8561 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (jammy) - medium.",
  "description": "A security issue was discovered in Kubernetes where actors that control the responses of MutatingWebhookConfiguration or ValidatingWebhookConfiguration requests are able to redirect kube-apiserver requests to private networks of the apiserver. If that user can view kube-apiserver logs when the log level is set to 10, they can view the redirected responses and headers in the logs.",
  "note": "leosilva\u003e kubernates is in fact a kubernetes installer that calls snap, not the package it self.",
