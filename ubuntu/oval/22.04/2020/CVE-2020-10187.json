An application is vulnerable if the authorized applications controller is enabled.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2020-10187` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nruby-doorkeeper - 5.0.3-1\nNo subscription required",
