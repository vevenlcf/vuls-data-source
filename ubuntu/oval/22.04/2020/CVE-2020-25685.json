  "title": "CVE-2020-25685 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (jammy) - medium.",
  "description": "A flaw was found in dnsmasq before version 2.83. When getting a reply from a forwarded query, dnsmasq checks in forward.c:reply_query(), which is the forwarded query that matches the reply, by only using a weak hash of the query name. Due to the weak hash (CRC32 when dnsmasq is compiled without DNSSEC, SHA-1 when it is) this flaw allows an off-path attacker to find several different domains all having the same hash, substantially reducing the number of attempts they would have to perform to forge a reply and get it accepted by dnsmasq. This is in contrast with RFC5452, which specifies that the query name is one of the attributes of a query that must be used to match a reply. This flaw could be abused to perform a DNS Cache Poisoning attack. If chained with CVE-2020-25684 the attack complexity of a successful attack is reduced. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data integrity.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2020-25685` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ndnsmasq - 2.82-1ubuntu2\ndnsmasq-base - 2.82-1ubuntu2\ndnsmasq-base-lua - 2.82-1ubuntu2\ndnsmasq-utils - 2.82-1ubuntu2\nNo subscription required",
