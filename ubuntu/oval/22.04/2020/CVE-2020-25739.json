  "title": "CVE-2020-25739 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (jammy) - medium.",
  "description": "An issue was discovered in the gon gem before gon-6.4.0 for Ruby. MultiJson does not honor the escape_mode parameter to escape fields as an XSS protection mechanism. To mitigate, json_dumper.rb in gon now does escaping for XSS by default without relying on MultiJson. It was discovered that Gon gem did not properly escape certain input. An attacker could use this vulnerability to execute a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2020-25739` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nruby-gon - 6.4.0-1\nNo subscription required",
