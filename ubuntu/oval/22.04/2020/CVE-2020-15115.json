  "title": "CVE-2020-15115 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (jammy) - low.",
  "description": "etcd before versions 3.3.23 and 3.4.10 does not perform any password length validation, which allows for very short passwords, such as those with a length of one. This may allow an attacker to guess or brute-force users' passwords with little computational effort.",
  "note": "ebarretto\u003e No fix available: The etcdctl and etcd API do not enforce a specific password length during user creation or user password update operations. It is the responsibility of the administrator to enforce these requirements.",
