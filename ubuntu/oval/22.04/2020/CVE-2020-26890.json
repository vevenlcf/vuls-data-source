  "title": "CVE-2020-26890 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (jammy) - medium.",
  "description": "Matrix Synapse before 1.20.0 erroneously permits non-standard NaN, Infinity, and -Infinity JSON values in fields of m.room.member events, allowing remote attackers to execute a denial of service attack against the federation and common Matrix clients. If such a malformed event is accepted into the room's state, the impact is long-lasting and is not fixed by an upgrade to a newer version, requiring the event to be manually redacted instead. Since events are replicated to servers of other room members, the impact is not constrained to the server of the event sender.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2020-26890` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nmatrix-synapse - 1.23.0-1\nNo subscription required",
