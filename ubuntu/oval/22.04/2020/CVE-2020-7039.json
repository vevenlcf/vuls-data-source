  "title": "CVE-2020-7039 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (jammy) - medium.",
  "description": "tcp_emu in tcp_subr.c in libslirp 4.1.0, as used in QEMU 4.2.0, mismanages memory, as demonstrated by IRC DCC commands in EMU_IRC. This can cause a heap-based buffer overflow or other out-of-bounds access which can lead to a DoS or potential execute arbitrary code. It was discovered that the SLiRP networking implementation of the QEMU emulator did not properly manage memory under certain circumstances. An attacker could use this to cause a heap-based buffer overflow or other out-of-bounds access, which can lead to a denial of service (application crash) or potential execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2020-7039` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibslirp0 - 4.1.0-2\nNo subscription required\n\nslirp - 1:1.0.17-10\nNo subscription required",
