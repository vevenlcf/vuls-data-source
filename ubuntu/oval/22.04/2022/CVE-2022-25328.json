  "title": "CVE-2022-25328 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (jammy) - medium.",
  "description": "The bash_completion script for fscrypt allows injection of commands via crafted mountpoint paths, allowing privilege escalation under a specific set of circumstances. A local user who has control over mountpoint paths could potentially escalate their privileges if they create a malicious mountpoint path and if the system administrator happens to be using the fscrypt bash completion script to complete mountpoint paths. We recommend upgrading to version 0.3.3 or above\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2022-25328` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nfscrypt - 0.3.3-1\nlibpam-fscrypt - 0.3.3-1\nNo subscription required",
