  "title": "CVE-2022-24758 on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (jammy) - medium.",
  "description": "The Jupyter notebook is a web-based notebook environment for interactive computing. Prior to version 6.4.9, unauthorized actors can access sensitive information from server logs. Anytime a 5xx error is triggered, the auth cookie and other header values are recorded in Jupyter server logs by default. Considering these logs do not require root access, an attacker can monitor these logs, steal sensitive auth/cookie information, and gain access to the Jupyter server. Jupyter notebook version 6.4.x contains a patch for this issue. There are currently no known workarounds.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2022-24758` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\njupyter-notebook - 6.4.8-1ubuntu0.1\npython3-notebook - 6.4.8-1ubuntu0.1\nNo subscription required",
