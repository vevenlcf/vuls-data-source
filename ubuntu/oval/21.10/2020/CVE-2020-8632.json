  "description": "In cloud-init through 19.4, rand_user_password in cloudinit/config/cc_set_passwords.py has a small default pwlen value, which makes it easier for attackers to guess passwords.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2020-8632` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ncloud-init - 21.3-1-g6803368d-0ubuntu3\nNo subscription required",
  "note": "ccdm94\u003e This CVE has been patched in Xenial ESM. The patch, however, has been added only to the updates pocket, and since cloud-init is only used during first boot (pulling from updates), there should not be a need to add this to the security pocket.",
