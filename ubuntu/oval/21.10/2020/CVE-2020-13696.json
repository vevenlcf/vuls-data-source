  "title": "CVE-2020-13696 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - low.",
  "description": "An issue was discovered in LinuxTV xawtv before 3.107. The function dev_open() in v4l-conf.c does not perform sufficient checks to prevent an unprivileged caller of the program from opening unintended filesystem paths. This allows a local attacker with access to the v4l-conf setuid-root program to test for the existence of arbitrary files and to trigger an open on arbitrary files with mode O_RDWR. To achieve this, relative path components need to be added to the device path, as demonstrated by a v4l-conf -c /dev/../root/.bash_history command.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2020-13696` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nalevtd - 3.107-1\nfbtv - 3.107-1\npia - 3.107-1\nradio - 3.107-1\nscantv - 3.107-1\nstreamer - 3.107-1\nttv - 3.107-1\nv4l-conf - 3.107-1\nwebcam - 3.107-1\nxawtv - 3.107-1\nxawtv-plugin-qt - 3.107-1\nxawtv-plugins - 3.107-1\nxawtv-tools - 3.107-1\nNo subscription required",
