  "description": "Xen through 4.14.x allows guest OS administrators to obtain sensitive information (such as AES keys from outside the guest) via a side-channel attack on a power/energy monitoring interface, aka a \"Platypus\" attack. NOTE: there is only one logically independent fix: to change the access control for each such interface in Xen.",
