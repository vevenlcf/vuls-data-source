  "title": "CVE-2020-8557 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - medium.",
  "description": "The Kubernetes kubelet component in versions 1.1-1.16.12, 1.17.0-1.17.8 and 1.18.0-1.18.5 do not account for disk usage by a pod which writes to its own /etc/hosts file. The /etc/hosts file mounted in a pod by kubelet is not included by the kubelet eviction manager when calculating ephemeral storage usage by a pod. If a pod writes a large amount of data to the /etc/hosts file, it could fill the storage space of the node and cause the node to fail.",
  "note": "leosilva\u003e kubernates is in fact a kubernetes installer that calls snap, not the package it self.",
