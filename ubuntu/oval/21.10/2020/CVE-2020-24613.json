  "title": "CVE-2020-24613 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - medium.",
  "description": "wolfSSL before 4.5.0 mishandles TLS 1.3 server data in the WAIT_CERT_CR state, within SanityCheckTls13MsgReceived() in tls13.c. This is an incorrect implementation of the TLS 1.3 client state machine. This allows attackers in a privileged network position to completely impersonate any TLS 1.3 servers, and read or modify potentially sensitive information between clients using the wolfSSL library and these TLS servers.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2020-24613` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibwolfssl24 - 4.5.0+dfsg-2\nNo subscription required",
