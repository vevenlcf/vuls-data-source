  "title": "CVE-2021-41617 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - low.",
  "description": "sshd in OpenSSH 6.2 through 8.x before 8.8, when certain non-default configurations are used, allows privilege escalation because supplemental groups are not initialized as expected. Helper programs for AuthorizedKeysCommand and AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand may run with privileges associated with group memberships of the sshd process, if the configuration specifies running the command as a different user.",
  "note": "seth-arnold\u003e openssh-ssh1 is provided for compatibility with old devices that cannot be upgraded to modern protocols. Thus we may not provide security support for this package if doing so would prevent access to equipment. mdeslaur\u003e Only applies to non-default configurations where AuthorizedKeysCommand or AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand are used. sespiros\u003e Cannot reproduce since sshd for all releases drops supplementary groups early when it starts with setgroups(0, NULL).",
