  "description": "A security issue was discovered in kube-apiserver that could allow node updates to bypass a Validating Admission Webhook. Clusters are only affected by this vulnerability if they run a Validating Admission Webhook for Nodes that denies admission based at least partially on the old state of the Node object. Validating Admission Webhook does not observe some previous fields.",
  "note": "leosilva\u003e kubernates is in fact a kubernetes installer that calls snap, not the package it self.",
