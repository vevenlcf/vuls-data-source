  "description": "An issue was discovered in Ruby through 2.6.7, 2.7.x through 2.7.3, and 3.x through 3.0.1. A malicious FTP server can use the PASV response to trick Net::FTP into connecting back to a given IP address and port. This potentially makes curl extract information about services that are otherwise private and not disclosed (e.g., the attacker can conduct port scans and service banner extractions).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2021-31810` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibruby2.7 - 2.7.4-1ubuntu1\nruby2.7 - 2.7.4-1ubuntu1\nNo subscription required",
