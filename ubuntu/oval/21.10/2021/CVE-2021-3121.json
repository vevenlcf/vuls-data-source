  "note": "sbeattie\u003e still need to sort which of all of the golang sources that build-depend on golang-gogoprotobuf-dev and golang-github-gogo-protobuf-dev need to be rebuilt. not sure how the 1.2.1 -\u003e 1.3.0 transition plays out here, it may be that some build dependencies had not been built yet with 1.3 .pb.go files, and rebuilding them in hirsute might trigger that. See https://github.com/gogo/protobuf#release-v130 for discussion on potential compatibility issues",
