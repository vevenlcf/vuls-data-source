  "description": "The \"Apache NetBeans\" autoupdate system does not validate SSL certificates and hostnames for https based downloads. This allows an attacker to intercept downloads of autoupdates and modify the download, potentially injecting malicious code. â€œApache NetBeans\" versions up to and including 11.2 are affected by this vulnerability.",
  "note": "seth-arnold\u003e Ubuntu users probably do not have privileges for this to work. Typically applications are updated via apt update or snap refresh. This sounds more like a Windows or OS X issue.",
