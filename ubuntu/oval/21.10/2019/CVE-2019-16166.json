  "description": "GNU cflow through 1.6 has a heap-based buffer over-read in the nexttoken function in parser.c.",
  "note": "ccdm94\u003e according to commit notes provided by upstream, the fix for this issue can be found in b9a7cd5e9d4. This is the same fix as the one for CVE-2019-16165. However, it seems like version 1.7, which would already include it, is still vulnerable to the issue, the reproducer file generating the same heap-based buffer overflow error when cflow is run with ASAN. Therefore, it seems like a patch for this vulnerability is still needed as of version 1.7.",
