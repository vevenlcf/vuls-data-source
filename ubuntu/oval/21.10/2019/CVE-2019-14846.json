  "description": "In Ansible, all Ansible Engine versions up to ansible-engine 2.8.5, ansible-engine 2.7.13, ansible-engine 2.6.19, were logging at the DEBUG level which lead to a disclosure of credentials if a plugin used a library that logged credentials at the DEBUG level. This flaw does not affect Ansible modules, as those are executed in a separate process.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2019-14846` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nansible - 2.8.6+dfsg-1\nNo subscription required",
