  "title": "CVE-2018-20760 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - medium.",
  "description": "In GPAC 0.7.1 and earlier, gf_text_get_utf8_line in media_tools/text_import.c in libgpac_static.a allows an out-of-bounds write because a certain -1 return value is mishandled. It was discovered that the GPAC MP4Box utility incorrectly handled certain memory operations. If an user or automated system were tricked into opening a specially crafted MP4 file, a remote attacker could use this issue to cause MP4Box to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2018-20760` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ngpac - 0.5.2-426-gc5ad4e4+dfsg5-5\ngpac-modules-base - 0.5.2-426-gc5ad4e4+dfsg5-5\nlibgpac10 - 0.5.2-426-gc5ad4e4+dfsg5-5\nNo subscription required",
