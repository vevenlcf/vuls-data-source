  "title": "CVE-2018-7167 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - medium.",
  "description": "Calling Buffer.fill() or Buffer.alloc() with some parameters can lead to a hang which could result in a Denial of Service. In order to address this vulnerability, the implementations of Buffer.alloc() and Buffer.fill() were updated so that they zero fill instead of hanging in these cases. All versions of Node.js 6.x (LTS \"Boron\"), 8.x (LTS \"Carbon\"), and 9.x are vulnerable. All versions of Node.js 10.x (Current) are NOT vulnerable. It was discovered that the Buffer.fill() and Buffer.alloc() methods improperly handled certain inputs. An attacker could use this vulnerability to cause a denial of service.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2018-7167` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibnode72 - 10.15.1~dfsg-5\nnodejs - 10.15.1~dfsg-5\nNo subscription required",
