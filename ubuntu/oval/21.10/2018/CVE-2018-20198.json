  "title": "CVE-2018-20198 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - medium.",
  "description": "A NULL pointer dereference was discovered in ifilter_bank of libfaad/filtbank.c in Freeware Advanced Audio Decoder 2 (FAAD2) 2.8.8. The vulnerability causes a segmentation fault and application crash, which leads to denial of service because adding to windowed output is mishandled in the LONG_START_SEQUENCE case. It was discovered that Freeware Advanced Audio Decoder 2 incorrectly handled implicit channel mapping reconfiguration when processing crafted AAC files. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2018-20198` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nfaad - 2.8.8-3ubuntu3\nlibfaad2 - 2.8.8-3ubuntu3\nNo subscription required",
