  "description": "Apache NetBeans (incubating) 9.0 NetBeans Proxy Auto-Configuration (PAC) interpretation is vulnerable for remote command execution (RCE). Using the nashorn script engine the environment of the javascript execution for the Proxy Auto-Configuration leaks privileged objects, that can be used to circumvent the execution limits. If a different script engine was used, no execution limits were in place. Both vectors allow remote code execution.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2018-17191` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibnb-absolutelayout-java - 10.0-3\nNo subscription required",
