  "title": "CVE-2017-7189 on Ubuntu 21.10 (impish) - low.",
  "description": "main/streams/xp_socket.c in PHP 7.x before 2017-03-07 misparses fsockopen calls, such as by interpreting fsockopen('127.0.0.1:80', 443) as if the address/port were 127.0.0.1:80:443, which is later truncated to 127.0.0.1:80. This behavior has a security risk if the explicitly provided port number (i.e., 443 in this example) is hardcoded into an application as a security policy, but the hostname argument (i.e., 127.0.0.1:80 in this example) is obtained from untrusted input.",
  "note": "mdeslaur\u003e the commit for this was later reverted as it introduced a regression. As of 2020-06-23, there is no upstream fix. rodrigo-zaiden\u003e As of 2022-02-04, there is still no upstream fix.",
