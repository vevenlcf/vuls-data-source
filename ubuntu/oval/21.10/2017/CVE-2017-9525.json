  "description": "In the cron package through 3.0pl1-128 on Debian, and through 3.0pl1-128ubuntu2 on Ubuntu, the postinst maintainer script allows for group-crontab-to-root privilege escalation via symlink attacks against unsafe usage of the chown and chmod programs.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2017-9525` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ncron - 3.0pl1-134ubuntu1\nNo subscription required",
  "note": "jj\u003e This appears to be mitigated by kernel symlink restrictions. The crontabs dir has the sticky bit set drwx-wx--T root crontab crontabs which means symlinks within the dir must have the same uid as the target. It is still possible that a cron package update could trigger this race. seth-arnold\u003e I believe that actually _exploiting_ the bug requires updating the cron package. So long as there's no updates for cron, the vulnerable code doesn't run. So if we find a second bug in cron then we really should fix the race condition at the same time, but so long as we don't push a cron update, the vulnerable code just plain doesn't run. the patch just narrows the time window for the race condition.",
