  "note": "ebarretto\u003e According to upstream: \"This issue impacts all Slurm releases since at least Slurm 1.0.0. Due to the severity of the CVE-2022-29500 issue, SchedMD has\" removed all prior Slurm releases from our download site. SchedMD only issues security fixes for the supported releases (currently 21.08 and 20.11). Due to the complexity of these fixes, we do not recommend attempting to backport the fixes to older releases, and strongly encourage sites to upgrade to fixed versions immediately.\" Therefore we won't be patching slurm-llnl",
