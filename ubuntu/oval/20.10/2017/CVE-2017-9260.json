  "description": "The TDStretchSSE::calcCrossCorr function in source/SoundTouch/sse_optimized.cpp in SoundTouch 1.9.2 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer over-read and application crash) via a crafted wav file. It was discovered that SoundTouch incorrectly handled certain WAV files. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service.",
