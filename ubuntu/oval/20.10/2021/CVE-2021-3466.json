  "description": "A flaw was found in libmicrohttpd in versions before 0.9.71. A missing bounds check in the post_process_urlencoded function leads to a buffer overflow, allowing a remote attacker to write arbitrary data in an application that uses libmicrohttpd. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.",
