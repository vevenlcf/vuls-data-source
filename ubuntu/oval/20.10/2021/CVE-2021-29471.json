  "description": "Synapse is a Matrix reference homeserver written in python (pypi package matrix-synapse). Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and VoIP. In Synapse before version 1.33.2 \"Push rules\" can specify conditions under which they will match, including `event_match`, which matches event content against a pattern including wildcards. Certain patterns can cause very poor performance in the matching engine, leading to a denial-of-service when processing moderate length events. The issue is patched in version 1.33.2. A potential workaround might be to prevent users from making custom push rules, by blocking such requests at a reverse-proxy.",
