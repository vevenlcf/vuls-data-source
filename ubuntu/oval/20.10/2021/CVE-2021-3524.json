  "description": "A flaw was found in the Red Hat Ceph Storage RadosGW (Ceph Object Gateway) in versions before 14.2.21. The vulnerability is related to the injection of HTTP headers via a CORS ExposeHeader tag. The newline character in the ExposeHeader tag in the CORS configuration file generates a header injection in the response when the CORS request is made. In addition, the prior bug fix for CVE-2020-10753 did not account for the use of \\r as a header separator, thus a new flaw has been created. Sergey Bobrov discovered that Ceph's RadosGW (Ceph Object Gateway) allowed the injection of HTTP headers in responses to CORS requests. An attacker could use this to violate system integrity.",
