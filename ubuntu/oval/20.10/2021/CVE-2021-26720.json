  "title": "CVE-2021-26720 on Ubuntu 20.10 (groovy) - low.",
  "description": "avahi-daemon-check-dns.sh in the Debian avahi package through 0.8-4 is executed as root via /etc/network/if-up.d/avahi-daemon, and allows a local attacker to cause a denial of service or create arbitrary empty files via a symlink attack on files under /run/avahi-daemon. NOTE: this only affects the packaging for Debian GNU/Linux (used indirectly by SUSE), not the upstream Avahi product.",
  "note": "mdeslaur\u003e the script was removed in the 0.7-4ubuntu7 package in focal. mdeslaur\u003e for bionic and earlier, we can't simply remove the script as mdeslaur\u003e libnss-mdns is too old there.",
