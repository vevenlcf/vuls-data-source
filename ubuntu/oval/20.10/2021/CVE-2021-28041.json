  "title": "CVE-2021-28041 on Ubuntu 20.10 (groovy) - medium.",
  "description": "ssh-agent in OpenSSH before 8.5 has a double free that may be relevant in a few less-common scenarios, such as unconstrained agent-socket access on a legacy operating system, or the forwarding of an agent to an attacker-controlled host.",
  "note": "seth-arnold\u003e openssh-ssh1 is provided for compatibility with old devices that cannot be upgraded to modern protocols. Thus we may not provide security support for this package if doing so would prevent access to equipment.",
