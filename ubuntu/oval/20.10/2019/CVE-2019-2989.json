  "title": "CVE-2019-2989 on Ubuntu 20.10 (groovy) - medium.",
  "description": "Vulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded product of Oracle Java SE (component: Networking). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 7u231, 8u221, 11.0.4 and 13; Java SE Embedded: 8u221. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded. While the vulnerability is in Java SE, Java SE Embedded, attacks may significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized creation, deletion or modification access to critical data or all Java SE, Java SE Embedded accessible data. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets (in Java SE 8), that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability can also be exploited by using APIs in the specified Component, e.g., through a web service which supplies data to the APIs. CVSS v3.0 Base Score 6.8 (Integrity impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N). It was discovered that the Networking component in OpenJDK did not properly handle certain responses from HTTP proxies. An attacker controlling a malicious HTTP proxy could possibly use this to inject content into a proxied HTTP connection.",
