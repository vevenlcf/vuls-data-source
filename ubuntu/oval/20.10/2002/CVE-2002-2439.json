  "description": "operator new[] sometimes returns pointers to heap blocks which are too small.  When a new array is allocated, the C++ run-time has to calculate its size.  The product may exceed the maximum value which can be stored in a machine register.  This error is ignored, and the truncated value is used for the heap allocation. This may lead to heap overflows and therefore security bugs. (See http://cert.uni-stuttgart.de/advisories/calloc.php for further references.)",
  "note": "sbeattie\u003e fixed upstream in gcc 4.8.0 sbeattie\u003e backporting fixes may be problematic for ABI issues sbeattie\u003e gcc-i686-linux-android/xenial is 4.7.4 based mdeslaur\u003e gcc-4.7 is not the default xenial compiler and is only used to mdeslaur\u003e build a few packages. Fixing this would be intrusive, would mdeslaur\u003e require rebuilding those packages, and there is no clear mdeslaur\u003e attack vector on them. We will not be fixing gcc-4.7 in xenial. mdeslaur\u003e Marking as ignored.",
