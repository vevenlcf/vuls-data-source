  "title": "CVE-2014-7191 on Ubuntu 20.10 (groovy) - medium.",
  "description": "The qs module before 1.0.0 in Node.js does not call the compact function for array data, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by using a large index value to create a sparse array. It was discovered that the qs module in Node.js incorrectly handled inputs. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service.",
  "note": "ebarretto\u003e This issue is actually for node-querystring. ebarretto\u003e Somewhere along the line node-qs was born or forked from ebarretto\u003e node-querystring which was deprecated. But now there are again ebarretto\u003e new projects called querystring. Be careful when updating. ebarretto\u003e Trusty's version is actually based on node-querystring.",
