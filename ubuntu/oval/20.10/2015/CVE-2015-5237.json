  "title": "CVE-2015-5237 on Ubuntu 20.10 (groovy) - low.",
  "description": "protobuf allows remote authenticated attackers to cause a heap-based buffer overflow.",
  "note": "seth-arnold\u003e No fix as of 2015-08-27, since the message parsing limit defaults to 64 megabytes a software author would have to change the limit in order to handle larger messages anyway, and is thus unlikely to generate these messages in the short-term. (There is no actual limit on generation, so this might be an issue today -- it is just not a priority for the maintainer.)",
