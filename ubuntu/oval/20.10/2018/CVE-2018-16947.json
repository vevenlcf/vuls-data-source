  "title": "CVE-2018-16947 on Ubuntu 20.10 (groovy) - medium.",
  "description": "An issue was discovered in OpenAFS before 1.6.23 and 1.8.x before 1.8.2. The backup tape controller (butc) process accepts incoming RPCs but does not require (or allow for) authentication of those RPCs. Handling those RPCs results in operations being performed with administrator credentials, including dumping/restoring volume contents and manipulating the backup database. For example, an unauthenticated attacker can replace any volume's content with arbitrary data.",
  "note": "msalvatore\u003e Per the upstream developers, \"The in-tree backup suite is not believed to be in common msalvatore\u003e use, so in that sense the impact is limited.  Applying a strict firewall msalvatore\u003e policy can also reduce the exposure of the butc to untrusted input and msalvatore\u003e provide some level of remediation.\"",
