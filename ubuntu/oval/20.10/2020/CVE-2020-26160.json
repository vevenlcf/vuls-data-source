  "description": "jwt-go before 4.0.0-preview1 allows attackers to bypass intended access restrictions in situations with []string{} for m[\"aud\"] (which is allowed by the specification). Because the type assertion fails, \"\" is the value of aud. This is a security problem if the JWT token is presented to a service that lacks its own audience check.",
  "note": "mdeslaur\u003e as of 2020-10-02, the proposed patches have not been accepted mdeslaur\u003e into the upstream tree. mdeslaur\u003e mdeslaur\u003e juju-core doesn't use jwt-go in a way that exposes the mdeslaur\u003e vulnerability",
