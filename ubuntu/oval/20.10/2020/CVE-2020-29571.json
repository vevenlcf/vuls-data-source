  "title": "CVE-2020-29571 on Ubuntu 20.10 (groovy) - medium.",
  "description": "An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. A bounds check common to most operation time functions specific to FIFO event channels depends on the CPU observing consistent state. While the producer side uses appropriately ordered writes, the consumer side isn't protected against re-ordered reads, and may hence end up de-referencing a NULL pointer. Malicious or buggy guest kernels can mount a Denial of Service (DoS) attack affecting the entire system. Only Arm systems may be vulnerable. Whether a system is vulnerable depends on the specific CPU. x86 systems are not vulnerable.",
  "note": "mdeslaur\u003e hypervisor packages are in universe. For mdeslaur\u003e issues in the hypervisor, add appropriate mdeslaur\u003e tags to each section, ex: mdeslaur\u003e Tags_xen: universe-binary",
