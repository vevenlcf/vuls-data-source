  "description": "Vulnerability in the Java SE product of Oracle Java SE (component: ImageIO). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 11.0.7 and 14.0.1. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability to cause a partial denial of service (partial DOS) of Java SE.
