  "description": "A flaw was found in samba. Spaces used in a string around a domain name (DN), while supposed to be ignored, can cause invalid DN strings with spaces to instead write a zero-byte into out-of-bounds memory, resulting in a crash. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.",
  "note": "mdeslaur\u003e This issue is actually in the ldb package, the samba package mdeslaur\u003e uses the system ldb library, not the included one",
