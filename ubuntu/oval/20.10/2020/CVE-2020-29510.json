  "title": "CVE-2020-29510 on Ubuntu 20.10 (groovy) - medium.",
  "description": "The encoding/xml package in Go versions 1.15 and earlier does not correctly preserve the semantics of directives during tokenization round-trips, which allows an attacker to craft inputs that behave in conflicting ways during different stages of processing in affected downstream applications.",
  "note": "mdeslaur\u003e Packages built using golang need to be rebuilt once the mdeslaur\u003e vulnerability has been fixed. This CVE entry does not mdeslaur\u003e list packages that need rebuilding outside of the main mdeslaur\u003e repository or the Ubuntu variants with PPA overlays. mdeslaur\u003e mdeslaur\u003e as of 2021-02-04, this doesn't appear to be fixed upstream",
