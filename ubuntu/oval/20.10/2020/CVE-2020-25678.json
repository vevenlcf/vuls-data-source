  "description": "A flaw was found in ceph in versions prior to 16.y.z where ceph stores mgr module passwords in clear text. This can be found by searching the mgr logs for grafana and dashboard, with passwords visible. It was discovered that in some situations Ceph logged passwords from the mgr module in clear text. An attacker could use this to expose sensitive information.",
