  "description": "A flaw was found in ceph-dashboard. The JSON Web Token (JWT) used for user authentication is stored by the frontend application in the browserâ€™s localStorage which is potentially vulnerable to attackers via XSS attacks. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity. It was discovered that the Ceph dashboard was susceptible to a cross-site scripting attack. An attacker could use this to expose sensitive information or gain unintended access.",
