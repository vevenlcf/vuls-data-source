  "title": "CVE-2019-12735 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
  "description": "getchar.c in Vim before 8.1.1365 and Neovim before 0.3.6 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands via the :source! command in a modeline, as demonstrated by execute in Vim, and assert_fails or nvim_input in Neovim. It was discovered that Vim incorrectly handled certain files. An attacker could possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary code.",
