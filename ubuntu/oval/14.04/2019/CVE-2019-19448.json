  "title": "CVE-2019-19448 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
  "description": "In the Linux kernel 5.0.21 and 5.3.11, mounting a crafted btrfs filesystem image, performing some operations, and then making a syncfs system call can lead to a use-after-free in try_merge_free_space in fs/btrfs/free-space-cache.c because the pointer to a left data structure can be the same as the pointer to a right data structure. It was discovered that the btrfs file system in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability when merging free space. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious btrfs image that, when mounted and operated on, could cause a denial of service (system crash).",
  "note": "tyhicks\u003e Exploiting this vulnerability requires a crafted filesystem image to be mounted sbeattie\u003e it's asserted that the btrfs enhanced tree-checker should address this issue; this was backported to at least the 4.15 kernels.",
