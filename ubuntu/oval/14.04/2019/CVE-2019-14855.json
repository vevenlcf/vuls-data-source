  "description": "A flaw was found in the way certificate signatures could be forged using collisions found in the SHA-1 algorithm. An attacker could use this weakness to create forged certificate signatures. This issue affects GnuPG versions before 2.2.18.",
  "note": "mdeslaur\u003e in master, gnupg disables SHA-1 signatures completely. In the 2.2 branch, it disables SHA-1 signatures after a certain date only. rodrigo-zaiden\u003e As of 2022-03-22 there is no upstream patch available for gnupg 1.4 series. Backporting from 2.2 would be too risky.",
