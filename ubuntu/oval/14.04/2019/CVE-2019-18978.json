  "title": "CVE-2019-18978 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
  "description": "An issue was discovered in the rack-cors (aka Rack CORS Middleware) gem before 1.0.4 for Ruby. It allows ../ directory traversal to access private resources because resource matching does not ensure that pathnames are in a canonical format. It was discovered that rack-cors did not properly handle relative file paths. An attacker could use this vulnerability to access arbitrary files.",
