  "title": "CVE-2019-11365 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
  "description": "An issue was discovered in atftpd in atftp 0.7.1. A remote attacker may send a crafted packet triggering a stack-based buffer overflow due to an insecurely implemented strncpy call. The vulnerability is triggered by sending an error packet of 3 bytes or fewer. There are multiple instances of this vulnerable strncpy pattern within the code base, specifically within tftpd_file.c, tftp_file.c, tftpd_mtftp.c, and tftp_mtftp.c. It was discovered that atftp's FTP server did not properly handler certain input. An attacker could use this to to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
