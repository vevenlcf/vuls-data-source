  "title": "CVE-2019-13960 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - negligible.",
  "description": "** DISPUTED ** In libjpeg-turbo 2.0.2, a large amount of memory can be used during processing of an invalid progressive JPEG image containing incorrect width and height values in the image header. NOTE: the vendor's expectation, for use cases in which this memory usage would be a denial of service, is that the application should interpret libjpeg warnings as fatal errors (aborting decompression) and/or set limits on resource consumption or image sizes.",
