  "description": "An out of bounds read flaw was discovered in libssh2 before 1.8.1 in the _libssh2_packet_require and _libssh2_packet_requirev functions. A remote attacker who compromises a SSH server may be able to cause a Denial of Service or read data in the client memory. It was discovered that libssh2 incorrectly handled certain specially crafted packets. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or obtain sensitive information.",
