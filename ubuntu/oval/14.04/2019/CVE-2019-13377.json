  "title": "CVE-2019-13377 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
  "description": "The implementations of SAE and EAP-pwd in hostapd and wpa_supplicant 2.x through 2.8 are vulnerable to side-channel attacks as a result of observable timing differences and cache access patterns when Brainpool curves are used. An attacker may be able to gain leaked information from a side-channel attack that can be used for full password recovery.",
  "note": "leosilva\u003e from Debian \"bug was added in v2.5\" mdeslaur\u003e SAE is not enabled in Ubuntu builds, some of the patches aren't required.",
