  "title": "CVE-2019-11360 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - negligible.",
  "description": "A buffer overflow in iptables-restore in netfilter iptables 1.8.2 allows an attacker to (at least) crash the program or potentially gain code execution via a specially crafted iptables-save file. This is related to add_param_to_argv in xshared.c.",
  "note": "mdeslaur\u003e To exploit this, you would need to trick someone into restoring a set of iptables rules from a malicious iptables-save file. This is quite an unlikely scenario. Reproducer doesn't work on xenial and bionic, like an issue in 1.8.2 only.",
