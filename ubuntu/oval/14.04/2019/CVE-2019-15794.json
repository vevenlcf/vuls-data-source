  "title": "CVE-2019-15794 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
  "description": "Overlayfs in the Linux kernel and shiftfs, a non-upstream patch to the Linux kernel included in the Ubuntu 5.0 and 5.3 kernel series, both replace vma-\u003evm_file in their mmap handlers. On error the original value is not restored, and the reference is put for the file to which vm_file points. On upstream kernels this is not an issue, as no callers dereference vm_file following after call_mmap() returns an error. However, the aufs patchs change mmap_region() to replace the fput() using a local variable with vma_fput(), which will fput() vm_file, leading to a refcount underflow. Jann Horn discovered that the OverlayFS and ShiftFS Drivers in the Linux kernel did not properly handle reference counting during memory mapping operations when used in conjunction with AUFS. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
