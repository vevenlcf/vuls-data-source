  "title": "CVE-2019-14877 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
  "description": "In the __mdiff function of the newlib libc library, all versions prior to 3.3.0 (see newlib/libc/stdlib/mprec.c), Balloc is used to allocate big integers, however no check is performed to verify if the allocation succeeded or not. The access to _wds and _sign will trigger a null pointer dereference bug in case of a memory allocation failure.",
