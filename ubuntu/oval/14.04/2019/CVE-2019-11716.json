  "title": "CVE-2019-11716 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
  "description": "Until explicitly accessed by script, window.globalThis is not enumerable and, as a result, is not visible to code such as Object.getOwnPropertyNames(window). Sites that deploy a sandboxing that depends on enumerating and freezing access to the window object may miss this, allowing their sandboxes to be bypassed. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 68.",
