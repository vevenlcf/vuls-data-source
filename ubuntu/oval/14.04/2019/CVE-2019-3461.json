  "title": "CVE-2019-3461 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
  "description": "Debian tmpreaper version 1.6.13+nmu1 has a race condition when doing a (bind) mount via rename() which could result in local privilege escalation. Mounting via rename() could potentially lead to a file being placed elsewhereon the filesystem hierarchy (e.g. /etc/cron.d/) if the directory being cleaned up was on the same physical filesystem. Fixed versions include 1.6.13+nmu1+deb9u1 and 1.6.14.",
  "note": "ebarretto\u003e Version on trusty needs the fix, but the fix depends on bind mounts from util-linux package. And the util-linux in trusty doesn't contain that feature. We could use another solution but I am not sure how this might affect the race condition.",
