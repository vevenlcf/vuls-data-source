  "title": "CVE-2019-19813 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
  "description": "In the Linux kernel 5.0.21, mounting a crafted btrfs filesystem image, performing some operations, and then making a syncfs system call can lead to a use-after-free in __mutex_lock in kernel/locking/mutex.c. This is related to mutex_can_spin_on_owner in kernel/locking/mutex.c, __btrfs_qgroup_free_meta in fs/btrfs/qgroup.c, and btrfs_insert_delayed_items in fs/btrfs/delayed-inode.c. It was discovered that the btrfs file system implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate file system metadata in some situations. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious btrfs image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash).",
  "note": "tyhicks\u003e As of 2020-01-09, no upstream fix is available sbeattie\u003e upstream developer asserts in suse bug that the enhanced btrfs tree-checker addresses this issue, which was backported to at least the 4.4 kernel.",
