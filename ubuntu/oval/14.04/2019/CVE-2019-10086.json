  "title": "CVE-2019-10086 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
  "description": "In Apache Commons Beanutils 1.9.2, a special BeanIntrospector class was added which allows suppressing the ability for an attacker to access the classloader via the class property available on all Java objects. We, however were not using this by default characteristic of the PropertyUtilsBean. It was discovered that Apache Commons BeanUtils improperly handled certain input.  An attacker could use this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code.",
