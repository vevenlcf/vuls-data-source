  "title": "CVE-2019-15847 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - negligible.",
  "description": "The POWER9 backend in GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) before version 10 could optimize multiple calls of the __builtin_darn intrinsic into a single call, thus reducing the entropy of the random number generator. This occurred because a volatile operation was not specified. For example, within a single execution of a program, the output of every __builtin_darn() call may be the same.",
  "note": "mdeslaur\u003e this is part of the power9 ISA, and Ubuntu binaries are built with the power8 ISA, so no binaries in the archive are affected  setting priority to negligible eslerm\u003e instruction set implementation for POWER9 began in gcc-6 affected darn instruction set implemented on 2016-06-02 which predates gcc-6.1.0",
