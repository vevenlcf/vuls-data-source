  "title": "CVE-2021-28691 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
  "description": "Guest triggered use-after-free in Linux xen-netback A malicious or buggy network PV frontend can force Linux netback to disable the interface and terminate the receive kernel thread associated with queue 0 in response to the frontend sending a malformed packet. Such kernel thread termination will lead to a use-after-free in Linux netback when the backend is destroyed, as the kernel thread associated with queue 0 will have already exited and thus the call to kthread_stop will be performed against a stale pointer. Michael Brown discovered that the Xen netback driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle malformed packets from a network PV frontend, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. An attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
