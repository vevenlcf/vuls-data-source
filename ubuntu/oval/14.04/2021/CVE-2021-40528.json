  "title": "CVE-2021-40528 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
  "description": "The ElGamal implementation in Libgcrypt before 1.9.4 allows plaintext recovery because, during interaction between two cryptographic libraries, a certain dangerous combination of the prime defined by the receiver's public key, the generator defined by the receiver's public key, and the sender's ephemeral exponents can lead to a cross-configuration attack against OpenPGP.",
  "note": "mdeslaur\u003e The commits below reference CVE-2021-33560, but they appear to actually be for this CVE, which was issued later. The original CVE was switched later on to the exponent blinding issue instead.",
