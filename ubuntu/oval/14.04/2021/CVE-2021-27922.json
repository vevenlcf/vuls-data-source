  "description": "Pillow before 8.1.1 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) because the reported size of a contained image is not properly checked for an ICNS container, and thus an attempted memory allocation can be very large.",
  "note": "mdeslaur\u003e while this is mentioned in the 8.1.1 release notes, it doesn't seem to be mentioned in the CHANGES file, and I can't seem to locate the commits that fix this in 8.1.1 vs 8.1.0 This was actually fixed in 8.1.2.",
