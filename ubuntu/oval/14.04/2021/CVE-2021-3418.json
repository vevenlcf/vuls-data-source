  "title": "CVE-2021-3418 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
  "description": "If certificates that signed grub are installed into db, grub can be booted directly. It will then boot any kernel without signature validation. The booted kernel will think it was booted in secureboot mode and will implement lockdown, yet it could have been tampered. This flaw is a reintroduction of CVE-2020-15705 and only affects grub2 versions prior to 2.06 and upstream and distributions using the shim_lock mechanism.",
  "note": "sbeattie\u003e does not affect grub2 as packaged in Ubuntu, we already had to address CVE-2020-15705. sbeattie\u003e grub2-unsigned will contain fixes and supersede grub2, which will contain only BIOS grub bits.",
