  "title": "CVE-2021-3493 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - high.",
  "description": "The overlayfs implementation in the linux kernel did not properly validate with respect to user namespaces the setting of file capabilities on files in an underlying file system. Due to the combination of unprivileged user namespaces along with a patch carried in the Ubuntu kernel to allow unprivileged overlay mounts, an attacker could use this to gain elevated privileges. It was discovered that the overlayfs implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate the application of file system capabilities with respect to user namespaces. A local attacker could use this to gain elevated privileges.",
  "note": "sbeattie\u003e issue is specific to Ubuntu or any other distribution that patched the kernel to allow unprivileged overlay mounts, prior to the 5.11 commit (459c7c565ac36b) that permits it upstream.",
