  "description": "A flaw was found in Ansible if an ansible user sets ANSIBLE_ASYNC_DIR to a subdirectory of a world writable directory. When this occurs, there is a race condition on the managed machine. A malicious, non-privileged account on the remote machine can exploit the race condition to access the async result data. This flaw affects Ansible Tower 3.7 and Ansible Automation Platform 1.2.",
