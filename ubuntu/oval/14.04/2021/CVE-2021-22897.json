  "title": "CVE-2021-22897 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - negligible.",
  "description": "curl 7.61.0 through 7.76.1 suffers from exposure of data element to wrong session due to a mistake in the code for CURLOPT_SSL_CIPHER_LIST when libcurl is built to use the Schannel TLS library. The selected cipher set was stored in a single \"static\" variable in the library, which has the surprising side-effect that if an application sets up multiple concurrent transfers, the last one that sets the ciphers will accidentally control the set used by all transfers. In a worst-case scenario, this weakens transport security significantly.",
  "note": "seth-arnold\u003e only affects builds with SCHANNEL -- I believe that requires windows.",
