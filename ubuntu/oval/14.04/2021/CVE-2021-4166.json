  "title": "CVE-2021-4166 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
  "description": "vim is vulnerable to Out-of-bounds Read",
  "note": "ccdm94\u003e code in bionic and earlier does not include file src/arglist.c, which is the patched file. The patched code for these releases seems to be instead present in src/buffer.c, as seen in commit 4ad62155a10. Changes that led to the creation of file arglist.c and changes made to the code that follow the creation of this file are significant, which would result in an intrusive backport should the altered CVE patch and other necessary changes be applied in bionic and earlier. Consequently, the issue will be marked as ignored for the previously mentioned releases.",
