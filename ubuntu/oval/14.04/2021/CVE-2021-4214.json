  "title": "CVE-2021-4214 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
  "description": "A heap overflow flaw was found in libpngs' pngimage.c program. This flaw allows an attacker with local network access to pass a specially crafted PNG file to the pngimage utility, causing an application to crash, leading to a denial of service.",
  "note": "mdeslaur\u003e The pngimage utility is only used during build to test well-known inputs. It is not shipped in the resulting binary packages, so while the vulnerable code exists in the libpng1.6 source package it is not used in an insecure way and is not present on end-user systems. Marking as not-affected. Code is not compiled at all in firefox.",
