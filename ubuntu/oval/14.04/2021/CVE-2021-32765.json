  "title": "CVE-2021-32765 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
  "description": "Hiredis is a minimalistic C client library for the Redis database. In affected versions Hiredis is vulnurable to integer overflow if provided maliciously crafted or corrupted `RESP` `mult-bulk` protocol data. When parsing `multi-bulk` (array-like) replies, hiredis fails to check if `count * sizeof(redisReply*)` can be represented in `SIZE_MAX`. If it can not, and the `calloc()` call doesn't itself make this check, it would result in a short allocation and subsequent buffer overflow. Users of hiredis who are unable to update may set the [maxelements](https://github.com/redis/hiredis#reader-max-array-elements) context option to a value small enough that no overflow is possible.",
  "note": "seth-arnold\u003e This feels like a bug in calloc() implementation, not in Hiredis. I'm marking this not-affected for us because our calloc(3) should do the right thing.",
