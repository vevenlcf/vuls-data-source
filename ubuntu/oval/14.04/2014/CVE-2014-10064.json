  "title": "CVE-2014-10064 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
  "description": "The qs module before 1.0.0 does not have an option or default for specifying object depth and when parsing a string representing a deeply nested object will block the event loop for long periods of time. An attacker could leverage this to cause a temporary denial-of-service condition, for example, in a web application, other requests would not be processed while this blocking is occurring.",
