  "description": "The default vhost configuration file in Puppet before 3.6.2 does not include the SSLCARevocationCheck directive, which might allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via a revoked certificate when a Puppet master runs with Apache 2.4.",
  "note": "sbeattie\u003e triggered under apache 2.4 only mdeslaur\u003e later Debian packages don't enable SSLCARevocationCheck by default, just simply add it as a commented-out example to the config file. We are not going to fix this in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. If this is required, it can simply be added to the local configuration.",
