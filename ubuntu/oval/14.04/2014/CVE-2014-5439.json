  "description": "Multiple Stack-based Buffer Overflow vulnerabilities exists in Sniffit prior to 0.3.7 via a crafted configuration file that will bypass Non-eXecutable bit NX, stack smashing protector SSP, and address space layout randomization ASLR protection mechanisms, which could let a malicious user execute arbitrary code. It was discovered that SniffIt incorrectly handled certain configuration files. An attacker could possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2014-5439` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nsniffit - 0.3.7.beta-17+deb8u1build0.14.04.1\nNo subscription required",
