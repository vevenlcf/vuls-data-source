  "title": "CVE-2014-4966 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
  "description": "Ansible before 1.6.7 does not prevent inventory data with \"{{\" and \"lookup\" substrings, and does not prevent remote data with \"{{\" substrings, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via (1) crafted lookup('pipe') calls or (2) crafted Jinja2 data. It was discovered that Ansible mishandled certain input. A remote attacker could use this to execute arbitrary code.",
