  "title": "CVE-2014-1420 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
  "description": "On desktop, Ubuntu UI Toolkit's StateSaver would serialise data on tmp/ files which an attacker could use to expose potentially sensitive data. StateSaver would also open files without the O_EXCL flag. An attacker could exploit this to launch a symlink attack, though this is partially mitigated by symlink and hardlink restrictions in Ubuntu. Fixed in 1.1.1188+14.10.20140813.4-0ubuntu1.",
