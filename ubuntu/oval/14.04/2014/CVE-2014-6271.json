  "description": "GNU Bash through 4.3 processes trailing strings after function definitions in the values of environment variables, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted environment, as demonstrated by vectors involving the ForceCommand feature in OpenSSH sshd, the mod_cgi and mod_cgid modules in the Apache HTTP Server, scripts executed by unspecified DHCP clients, and other situations in which setting the environment occurs across a privilege boundary from Bash execution, aka \"ShellShock.\"  NOTE: the original fix for this issue was incorrect; CVE-2014-7169 has been assigned to cover the vulnerability that is still present after the incorrect fix.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2014-6271` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nbash - 4.3-7ubuntu1.1\nbash-builtins - 4.3-7ubuntu1.1\nbash-static - 4.3-7ubuntu1.1\nNo subscription required",
