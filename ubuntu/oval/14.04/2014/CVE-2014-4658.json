  "description": "The vault subsystem in Ansible before 1.5.5 does not set the umask before creation or modification of a vault file, which allows local users to obtain sensitive key information by reading a file. It was discovered that Ansible did not properly set permissions upon creation or modification of a vault file. A local attacker could use this to obtain sensitive information.",
