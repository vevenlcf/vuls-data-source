  "description": "GNU Bash through 4.3 bash43-025 processes trailing strings after certain malformed function definitions in the values of environment variables, which allows remote attackers to write to files or possibly have unknown other impact via a crafted environment, as demonstrated by vectors involving the ForceCommand feature in OpenSSH sshd, the mod_cgi and mod_cgid modules in the Apache HTTP Server, scripts executed by unspecified DHCP clients, and other situations in which setting the environment occurs across a privilege boundary from Bash execution.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2014-6271.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2014-7169` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nbash - 4.3-7ubuntu1.3\nbash-builtins - 4.3-7ubuntu1.3\nbash-static - 4.3-7ubuntu1.3\nNo subscription required",
