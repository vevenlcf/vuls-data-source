  "description": "Stack-based buffer overflow in the inet_pton function in network/inet_pton.c in musl libc 0.9.15 through 1.0.4, and 1.1.0 through 1.1.7 allows attackers to have unspecified impact via unknown vectors. It was discovered that musl did not properly handle parsing of ipv6 addresses. An attacker could use this vulnerability to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
