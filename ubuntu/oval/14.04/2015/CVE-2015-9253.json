  "title": "CVE-2015-9253 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
  "description": "An issue was discovered in PHP 7.3.x before 7.3.0alpha3, 7.2.x before 7.2.8, and before 7.1.20. The php-fpm master process restarts a child process in an endless loop when using program execution functions (e.g., passthru, exec, shell_exec, or system) with a non-blocking STDIN stream, causing this master process to consume 100% of the CPU, and consume disk space with a large volume of error logs, as demonstrated by an attack by a customer of a shared-hosting facility.",
  "note": "leosilva\u003e in 7.0 upstream patch caused a regression according with upstream that is the possible the missing patch: https://github.com/php/php-src/commit/cc5c51e7f0732067f105d13c6d355fcab5965c2f rodrigo-zaiden\u003e php7.0 for xenial was released with above patch.",
