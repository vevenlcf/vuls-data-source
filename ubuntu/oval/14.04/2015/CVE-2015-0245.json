  "title": "CVE-2015-0245 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
  "description": "D-Bus 1.4.x through 1.6.x before 1.6.30, 1.8.x before 1.8.16, and 1.9.x before 1.9.10 does not validate the source of ActivationFailure signals, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (activation failure error returned) by leveraging a race condition involving sending an ActivationFailure signal before systemd responds.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2015-0245` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ndbus - 1.6.18-0ubuntu4.4\ndbus-x11 - 1.6.18-0ubuntu4.4\nlibdbus-1-3 - 1.6.18-0ubuntu4.4\nNo subscription required",
  "note": "seth-arnold\u003e The policy change is recommended for stable use, though the code-based changes were made for platforms where uid==0 may not be omnipotent -- we should probably use both in our packages, or at least both for the versions with distro-patched AppArmor support.",
