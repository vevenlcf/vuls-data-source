  "title": "CVE-2015-3153 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
  "description": "The default configuration for cURL and libcurl before 7.42.1 sends custom HTTP headers to both the proxy and destination server, which might allow remote proxy servers to obtain sensitive information by reading the header contents.",
  "note": "mdeslaur\u003e in curl versions before 7.37.0, the same headers are always sent to both the destination server and the proxy. In 7.37.0, two new options were introduced to control which headers are sent to the server and which headers are sent to the proxy: CURLOPT_HEADEROPT and CURLOPT_PROXYHEADER. The default is to send the headers to both servers, contrary to expectations. The fix is to change the default to send separate headers.  Introducing split header functionality in older versions of curl is intrusive, and will change behaviour. We will not be fixing this issue in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and earlier.",
