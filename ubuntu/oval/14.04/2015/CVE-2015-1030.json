  "title": "CVE-2015-1030 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
  "description": "Memory leak in the rfc2553_connect_to function in jbsocket.c in Privoxy before 3.0.22 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via a large number of requests that are rejected because the socket limit is reached. It was discovered that privoxy doesn't handle a large number of requests properly. An attacker could use this vulnerability to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2015-1030` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nprivoxy - 3.0.21-7+debu1build0.14.04.1\nNo subscription required",
