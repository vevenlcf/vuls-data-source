  "description": "Use-after-free vulnerability in the ff_h264_free_tables function in libavcodec/h264.c in FFmpeg before 2.3.6 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted H.264 data in an MP4 file, as demonstrated by an HTML VIDEO element that references H.264 data. It was discovered that Libav incorrectly handled certain media files. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or other unspecified impact.",
