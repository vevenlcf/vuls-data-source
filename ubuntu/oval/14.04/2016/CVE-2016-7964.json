  "title": "CVE-2016-7964 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
  "description": "The sendRequest method in HTTPClient Class in file /inc/HTTPClient.php in DokuWiki 2016-06-26a and older, when media file fetching is enabled, has no way to restrict access to private networks. This allows users to scan ports of internal networks via SSRF, such as 10.0.0.1/8, 172.16.0.0/12, and 192.168.0.0/16.",
  "note": "ebarretto\u003e Setting status as ignored since upstream won't fix it. According to maintainer: The only way I see to properly fix this is to add a whitelist feature where an Admin can define the external hosts and IPs the wiki is allowed to contact. However for not breaking every already installed wiki we would need to keep this list empty (allowing all). TBH I feel like it's not our task to secure other computers. If a wiki server runs within a network that should not be reached from that wiki server, the wiki server should be isolated properly through at least outgoing firewall rules or by a proper DMZ setup.",
