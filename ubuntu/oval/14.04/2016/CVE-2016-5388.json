  "title": "CVE-2016-5388 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
  "description": "Apache Tomcat 7.x through 7.0.70 and 8.x through 8.5.4, when the CGI Servlet is enabled, follows RFC 3875 section 4.1.18 and therefore does not protect applications from the presence of untrusted client data in the HTTP_PROXY environment variable, which might allow remote attackers to redirect an application's outbound HTTP traffic to an arbitrary proxy server via a crafted Proxy header in an HTTP request, aka an \"httpoxy\" issue. NOTE: the vendor states \"A mitigation is planned for future releases of Tomcat, tracked as CVE-2016-5388\"; in other words, this is not a CVE ID for a vulnerability.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2016-5388` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibservlet3.0-java - 7.0.52-1ubuntu0.8\nlibtomcat7-java - 7.0.52-1ubuntu0.8\ntomcat7 - 7.0.52-1ubuntu0.8\ntomcat7-admin - 7.0.52-1ubuntu0.8\ntomcat7-common - 7.0.52-1ubuntu0.8\ntomcat7-examples - 7.0.52-1ubuntu0.8\ntomcat7-user - 7.0.52-1ubuntu0.8\nNo subscription required",
