  "description": "Crypto++ (aka cryptopp) through 5.6.4 does not document the requirement for a compile-time NDEBUG definition disabling the many assert calls that are unintended in production use, which might allow context-dependent attackers to obtain sensitive information by leveraging access to process memory after an assertion failure, as demonstrated by reading a core dump.",
  "note": "ratliff\u003e precise, trusty, xenial, yakkety all build using -NDEBUG msalvatore\u003e I'm retiring this CVE and marking each release as \"ignored\". I've confirmed ratliff's above comment. In addition, the fix for this CVE is simply an update to the documentation.",
