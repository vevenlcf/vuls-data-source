  "title": "CVE-2016-7030 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
  "description": "FreeIPA uses a default password policy that locks an account after 5 unsuccessful authentication attempts, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service by locking out the account in which system services run on. It was discovered that FreeIPA incorrectly handled authentication attempts. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service.",
