  "description": "redirect() in bottle.py in bottle 0.12.10 doesn't filter a \"\\r\\n\" sequence, which leads to a CRLF attack, as demonstrated by a redirect(\"233\\r\\nSet-Cookie: name=salt\") call. It was discovered that Bottle improperly handles headers. An attacker could possibly exploit this as a CRLF attack.",
