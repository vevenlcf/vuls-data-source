  "description": "The wrap_lines_smart function in ass_render.c in libass before 0.13.4 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) via unspecified vectors, related to \"0/3 line wrapping equalization.\" It was discovered that LibASS incorrectly handled certain ASS files. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service.",
