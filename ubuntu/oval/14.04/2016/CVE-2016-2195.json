  "title": "CVE-2016-2195 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
  "description": "Integer overflow in the PointGFp constructor in Botan before 1.10.11 and 1.11.x before 1.11.27 allows remote attackers to overwrite memory and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted ECC point, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow. The bigint_mul and bigint_sqr functions received the size of the output buffer, but only used it to dispatch to a faster algorithm in cases where there was sufficient output space to call an unrolled multiplication function. The result is a heap overflow accessible via ECC point decoding, which accepted untrusted inputs. This is likely exploitable for remote code execution.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2016-2195` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibbotan-1.10-0 - 1.10.5-1+deb7u1ubuntu0.14.04.1\nNo subscription required",
