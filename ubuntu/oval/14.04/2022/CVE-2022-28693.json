  "description": "Unprotected alternative channel of return branch target prediction in some Intel(R) Processors may allow an authorized user to potentially enable information disclosure via local access. Alternative form of return branch target prediction in some Intel(R) Processors may allow an authorized user to potentially enable information disclosure via local access. . RSBA behavior allows alternate branch predictors to be used by near RET instructions when the RSB is empty. When eIBRS is enabled, the predicted target of these alternate predictors are restricted to those belonging to the indirect branch predictor entries of the current prediction domain.",
