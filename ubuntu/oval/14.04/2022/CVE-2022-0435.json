  "title": "CVE-2022-0435 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
  "description": "A stack overflow flaw was found in the Linux kernel's TIPC protocol functionality in the way a user sends a packet with malicious content where the number of domain member nodes is higher than the 64 allowed. This flaw allows a remote user to crash the system or possibly escalate their privileges if they have access to the TIPC network. Samuel Page discovered that the Transparent Inter-Process Communication (TIPC) protocol implementation in the Linux kernel contained a stack-based buffer overflow. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) for systems that have a TIPC bearer configured.",
  "note": "sbeattie\u003e introduced in v4.8 mitigated by CONFIG_FORTIFY_SOURCE, enabled in Ubuntu kernels since v4.18 kernels (Ubuntu 18.10 and newer, as well as HWE kernels for 18.04 LTS), mitigates this into a DoS. for 4.15 kernels as used in 18.04 LTS and HWE for 16.04 ESM, kernels are built with stack-protector, which makes this more difficult to exploit.",
