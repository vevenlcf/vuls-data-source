  "title": "CVE-2020-10878 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
  "description": "Perl before 5.30.3 has an integer overflow related to mishandling of a \"PL_regkind[OP(n)] == NOTHING\" situation. A crafted regular expression could lead to malformed bytecode with a possibility of instruction injection.  An application written in Perl would only be vulnerable to this flaw if  it evaluates regular expressions supplied by the attacker. Evaluating  regular expressions in this fashion is known to be dangerous since the  regular expression engine does not protect against denial of service  attacks in this usage scenario.]",
