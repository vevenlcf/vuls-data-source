  "description": "In PHP versions 7.2.x below 7.2.29, 7.3.x below 7.3.16 and 7.4.x below 7.4.4, while using get_headers() with user-supplied URL, if the URL contains zero (\\0) character, the URL will be silently truncated at it. This may cause some software to make incorrect assumptions about the target of the get_headers() and possibly send some information to a wrong server.",
  "note": "sbeattie\u003e PEAR issues should go against php-pear as of xenial leosilva\u003e php5 in precise is 5.3 and does not support the Zend API needed to fix this issue. Since backport this is to intrusive, marking it as ignored for precise/esm.",
