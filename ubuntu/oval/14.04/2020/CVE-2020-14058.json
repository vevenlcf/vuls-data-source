  "title": "CVE-2020-14058 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
  "description": "An issue was discovered in Squid before 4.12 and 5.x before 5.0.3. Due to use of a potentially dangerous function, Squid and the default certificate validation helper are vulnerable to a Denial of Service when opening a TLS connection to an attacker-controlled server for HTTPS. This occurs because unrecognized error values are mapped to NULL, but later code expects that each error value is mapped to a valid error string.",
  "note": "mdeslaur\u003e In Ubuntu, squid is built without openssl support, so this is not an issue.",
