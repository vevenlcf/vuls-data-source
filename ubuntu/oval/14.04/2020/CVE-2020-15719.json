  "title": "CVE-2020-15719 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
  "description": "libldap in certain third-party OpenLDAP packages has a certificate-validation flaw when the third-party package is asserting RFC6125 support. It considers CN even when there is a non-matching subjectAltName (SAN). This is fixed in, for example, openldap-2.4.46-10.el8 in Red Hat Enterprise Linux.",
  "note": "mdeslaur\u003e See RH bug for possible regression fixes per upstream bug, this is an issue with a RH patch to openldap and doesn't apply to upstream openldap. Marking as not-affected since Ubuntu does not carry the patch.",
