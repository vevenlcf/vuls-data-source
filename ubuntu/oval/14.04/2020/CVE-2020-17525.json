  "title": "CVE-2020-17525 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
  "description": "Subversion's mod_authz_svn module will crash if the server is using in-repository authz rules with the AuthzSVNReposRelativeAccessFile option and a client sends a request for a non-existing repository URL. This can lead to disruption for users of the service. This issue was fixed in mod_dav_svn+mod_authz_svn servers 1.14.1 and mod_dav_svn+mod_authz_svn servers 1.10.7 Thomas Åkesson discovered that Subversion incorrectly handled certain inputs. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service.",
