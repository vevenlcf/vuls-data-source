  "title": "CVE-2020-27171 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - high.",
  "description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.11.8. kernel/bpf/verifier.c has an off-by-one error (with a resultant integer underflow) affecting out-of-bounds speculation on pointer arithmetic, leading to side-channel attacks that defeat Spectre mitigations and obtain sensitive information from kernel memory, aka CID-10d2bb2e6b1d. Piotr Krysiuk discovered that the BPF subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly compute a speculative execution limit on pointer arithmetic in some situations. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).",
  "note": "amurray\u003e According to the upstream advisory, 10d2bb2e6b1d8c4576c56a748f697dbeb8388899 is the minimal fix but the whole series should be applied together",
