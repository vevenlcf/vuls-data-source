  "title": "CVE-2020-7221 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
  "description": "mysql_install_db in MariaDB 10.4.7 through 10.4.11 allows privilege escalation from the mysql user account to root because chown and chmod are performed unsafely, as demonstrated by a symlink attack on a chmod 04755 of auth_pam_tool_dir/auth_pam_tool. NOTE: this does not affect the Oracle MySQL product, which implements mysql_install_db differently.",
  "note": "leosilva\u003e since 5.5 is no longer upstream supported and so far we cannot patch it, marking it as ignored.",
