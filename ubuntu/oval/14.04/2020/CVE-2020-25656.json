  "title": "CVE-2020-25656 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
  "description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A use-after-free was found in the way the console subsystem was using ioctls KDGKBSENT and KDSKBSENT. A local user could use this flaw to get read memory access out of bounds. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality. It was discovered that the console keyboard driver in the Linux kernel contained a race condition. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).",
