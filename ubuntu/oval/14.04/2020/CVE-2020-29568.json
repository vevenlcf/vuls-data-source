  "title": "CVE-2020-29568 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
  "description": "An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. Some OSes (such as Linux, FreeBSD, and NetBSD) are processing watch events using a single thread. If the events are received faster than the thread is able to handle, they will get queued. As the queue is unbounded, a guest may be able to trigger an OOM in the backend. All systems with a FreeBSD, Linux, or NetBSD (any version) dom0 are vulnerable. Michael Kurth and Pawel Wieczorkiewicz discovered that the Xen event processing backend in the Linux kernel did not properly limit the number of events queued. An attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a denial of service in the host OS.",
