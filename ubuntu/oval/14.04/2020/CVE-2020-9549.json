  "description": "In PDFResurrect 0.12 through 0.19, get_type in pdf.c has an out-of-bounds write via a crafted PDF document. It was discovered that PDFResurrect incorrectly handled certain memory operations during PDF summary generation. An attacker could use this to cause out-of-bounds writes, resulting in a denial of service (system crash) or arbitrary code execution.",
