  "title": "CVE-2020-8835 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - high.",
  "description": "In the Linux kernel 5.5.0 and newer, the bpf verifier (kernel/bpf/verifier.c) did not properly restrict the register bounds for 32-bit operations, leading to out-of-bounds reads and writes in kernel memory. The vulnerability also affects the Linux 5.4 stable series, starting with v5.4.7, as the introducing commit was backported to that branch. This vulnerability was fixed in 5.6.1, 5.5.14, and 5.4.29. (issue is aka ZDI-CAN-10780) Manfred Paul discovered that the bpf verifier in the Linux kernel did not properly calculate register bounds for certain operations. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory) or gain administrative privileges.",
  "note": "sbeattie\u003e introduced by upstream commit 581738a681b6, which was mistakenly backported to upstream stable 5.4 kernel (b4de258dede528f88f401259aab3147fb6da1ddf). Ubuntu's 5.3 kernels are affected because 5.4 stable backport commits were pulled into Ubuntu's 5.3 kernels.",
