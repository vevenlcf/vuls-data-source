  "title": "CVE-2020-5529 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
  "description": "HtmlUnit prior to 2.37.0 contains code execution vulnerabilities. HtmlUnit initializes Rhino engine improperly, hence a malicious JavScript code can execute arbitrary Java code on the application. Moreover, when embedded in Android application, Android-specific initialization of Rhino engine is done in an improper way, hence a malicious JavaScript code can execute arbitrary Java code on the application. It was discovered that HtmlUnit incorrectly initialized Rhino engine. An Attacker could possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary Java code.",
