  "description": "Mozilla developers reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox and Thunderbird 68.5. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird \u003c 68.6, Firefox \u003c 74, Firefox \u003c ESR68.6, and Firefox ESR \u003c 68.6.",
