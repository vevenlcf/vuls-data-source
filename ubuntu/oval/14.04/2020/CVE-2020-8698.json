  "description": "Improper isolation of shared resources in some Intel(R) Processors may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable information disclosure via local access. Ezra Caltum, Joseph Nuzman, Nir Shildan and Ofir Joseff discovered that some Intel(R) Processors did not properly isolate shared resources in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to expose sensitive information.",
