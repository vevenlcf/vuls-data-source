  "title": "CVE-2020-8608 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
  "description": "In libslirp 4.1.0, as used in QEMU 4.2.0, tcp_subr.c misuses snprintf return values, leading to a buffer overflow in later code. It was discovered that the SLiRP networking implementation of the QEMU emulator misuses snprintf return values. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (application crash) or potentially execute arbitrary code.",
  "note": "mdeslaur\u003e possible better approach would be to disable tcp_emu completely https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/slirp/libslirp/commit/07c2a44b67e219ac14207f7a1b33704e1312cf91",
