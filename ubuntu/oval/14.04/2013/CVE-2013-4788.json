  "title": "CVE-2013-4788 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
  "description": "The PTR_MANGLE implementation in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) 2.4, 2.17, and earlier, and Embedded GLIBC (EGLIBC) does not initialize the random value for the pointer guard, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to control execution flow by leveraging a buffer-overflow vulnerability in an application and using the known zero value pointer guard to calculate a pointer address.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2013-4788` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\neglibc-source - 2.18-0ubuntu1\nlibc-bin - 2.18-0ubuntu1\nlibc6 - 2.18-0ubuntu1\nlibc6-amd64 - 2.18-0ubuntu1\nlibc6-armel - 2.18-0ubuntu1\nlibc6-i386 - 2.18-0ubuntu1\nlibc6-pic - 2.18-0ubuntu1\nlibc6-ppc64 - 2.18-0ubuntu1\nlibc6-prof - 2.18-0ubuntu1\nlibc6-x32 - 2.18-0ubuntu1\nmultiarch-support - 2.18-0ubuntu1\nnscd - 2.18-0ubuntu1\nNo subscription required",
  "note": "jdstrand\u003e PoC in linux-distros@ (tested on Ubuntu 12.04, 13.04 and Debian 7.1) Only statically compiled executables, dynamic not affected upstream patch not available as of 2013-07-12 seth-arnold\u003e PTR MANGLE is a security-hardening feature; exploiting this flaw requires a flaw in a statically linked executable that allows write access to one of the types of pointers that is mangled. Fixing the consequences of this flaw requires rebuilding all security-sensitive statically linked executables. mdeslaur\u003e fix for this was reverted in saucy as it was causing the ARM testuite to fail. sbeattie\u003e fix was re-enabled in trusty with the addition of the patches/any/cvs-CVE-2013-4788-static-ptrguard-arm.diff patch. mdeslaur\u003e we will not be fixing this issue for earlier releases.",
