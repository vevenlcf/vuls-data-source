  "title": "CVE-2013-6417 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
  "description": "actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/http/request.rb in Ruby on Rails before 3.2.16 and 4.x before 4.0.2 does not properly consider differences in parameter handling between the Active Record component and the JSON implementation, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended database-query restrictions and perform NULL checks or trigger missing WHERE clauses via a crafted request that leverages (1) third-party Rack middleware or (2) custom Rack middleware.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2013-0155.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2013-6417` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nruby-actionpack-3.2 - 3.2.16-3\nNo subscription required",
