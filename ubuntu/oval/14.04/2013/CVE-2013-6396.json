  "title": "CVE-2013-6396 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
  "description": "The OpenStack Python client library for Swift (python-swiftclient) 1.0 through 1.9.0 does not verify X.509 certificates from SSL servers, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof servers and obtain sensitive information via a crafted certificate.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2013-6396` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\npython-swiftclient - 1:2.0.3-0ubuntu1\nNo subscription required",
  "note": "mdeslaur\u003e OSSA 2014-005 jdstrand\u003e certificate verification checks are completely missing. Patch is intrusive and may not be applied to 13.10. Patch adds an --insecure option that would have to be enabled by default in the security update so as not to break production systems. Depending on upstream's decision, Ubuntu may only fix 14.04. mdeslaur\u003e fixed in 2.0",
