  "description": "The unity-firefox-extension package could be tricked into dropping a C callback which was still in use, which Firefox would then free, causing Firefox to crash. This could be achieved by adding an action to the launcher and updating it with new callbacks until the libunity-webapps rate limit was hit. Fixed in 3.0.0+14.04.20140416-0ubuntu1.14.04.1 of unity-firefox-extension and in all versions of libunity-webapps by shipping an empty unity-firefox-extension package, thus disabling the extension entirely and invalidating the attack against the libunity-webapps package.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2013-1055` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibufe-xidgetter0 - 3.0.0+14.04.20140416-0ubuntu1.14.04.1\nxul-ext-unity - 3.0.0+14.04.20140416-0ubuntu1.14.04.1\nNo subscription required",
