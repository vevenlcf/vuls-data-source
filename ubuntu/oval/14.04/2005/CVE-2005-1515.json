  "description": "Integer signedness error in the qmail_put and substdio_put functions in qmail, when running on 64 bit platforms with a large amount of virtual memory, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code via a large number of SMTP RCPT TO commands. It was discovered that netqmail did not properly handle certain input. Both remote and local attackers could use this vulnerability to cause netqmail to crash or execute arbitrary code.",
