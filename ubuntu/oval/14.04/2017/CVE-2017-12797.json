  "title": "CVE-2017-12797 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
  "description": "Integer overflow in the INT123_parse_new_id3 function in the ID3 parser in mpg123 before 1.25.5 on 32-bit platforms allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via a crafted file, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow. It was discovered that mpg123 incorrectly handled certain media files. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or other unspecified impact.",
