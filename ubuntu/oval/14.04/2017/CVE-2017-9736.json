  "note": "seth-arnold\u003e The patches look like this is a simple black-list functionality but doesn't black-list $() or `` or \u003c() or any other number of shell metacharacters. I expect this is still broken and should use a whitelist of a-z0-9_-. msalvatore\u003e \"SPIP 3.0.x and earlier versions are not affected by this issue.\"",
