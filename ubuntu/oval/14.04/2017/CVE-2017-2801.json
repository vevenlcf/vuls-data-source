  "title": "CVE-2017-2801 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
  "description": "A programming error exists in a way Randombit Botan cryptographic library version 2.0.1 implements x500 string comparisons which could lead to certificate verification issues and abuse. A specially crafted X509 certificate would need to be delivered to the client or server application in order to trigger this vulnerability. It was discovered that Botan did not properly manage x509 DN strings comparisons when provided with a specially crafted X509 certificate. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause out of bound reads, resulting in information leakage, denial of service, or potentially incorrect certificate validation results.",
