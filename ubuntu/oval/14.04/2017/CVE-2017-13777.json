  "title": "CVE-2017-13777 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
  "description": "GraphicsMagick 1.3.26 has a denial of service issue in ReadXBMImage() in a coders/xbm.c \"Read hex image data\" version==10 case that results in the reader not returning; it would cause large amounts of CPU and memory consumption although the crafted file itself does not request it. It was discovered that GraphicsMagick incorrectly handled certain image files. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or other unspecified impact.",
