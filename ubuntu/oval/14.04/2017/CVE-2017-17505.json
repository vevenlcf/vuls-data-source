  "description": "In HDF5 1.10.1, there is a NULL pointer dereference in the function H5O_pline_decode in the H5Opline.c file in libhdf5.a. For example, h5dump would crash when someone opens a crafted hdf5 file. It was discovered that HDF5 incorrectly handled certain hdf5 files. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service.",
