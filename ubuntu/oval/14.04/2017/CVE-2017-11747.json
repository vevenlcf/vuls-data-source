  "title": "CVE-2017-11747 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
  "description": "main.c in Tinyproxy 1.8.4 and earlier creates a /run/tinyproxy/tinyproxy.pid file after dropping privileges to a non-root account, which might allow local users to kill arbitrary processes by leveraging access to this non-root account for tinyproxy.pid modification before a root script executes a \"kill `cat /run/tinyproxy/tinyproxy.pid`\" command. It was discovered that Tinyproxy created its pid file with insecure permissions. An attacker could use the vulnerability to cause arbitrary processes to be killed, resulting in a denial of service.",
