  "title": "CVE-2017-12375 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
  "description": "The ClamAV AntiVirus software versions 0.99.2 and prior contain a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to a lack of input validation checking mechanisms during certain mail parsing functions (the rfc2047 function in mbox.c). An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted email to the affected device. This action could cause a buffer overflow condition when ClamAV scans the malicious email, allowing the attacker to potentially cause a DoS condition on an affected device.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2017-12375` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nclamav - 0.99.3+addedllvm-0ubuntu0.14.04.1\nclamav-base - 0.99.3+addedllvm-0ubuntu0.14.04.1\nclamav-daemon - 0.99.3+addedllvm-0ubuntu0.14.04.1\nclamav-freshclam - 0.99.3+addedllvm-0ubuntu0.14.04.1\nclamav-milter - 0.99.3+addedllvm-0ubuntu0.14.04.1\nclamav-testfiles - 0.99.3+addedllvm-0ubuntu0.14.04.1\nlibclamav7 - 0.99.3+addedllvm-0ubuntu0.14.04.1\nNo subscription required",
