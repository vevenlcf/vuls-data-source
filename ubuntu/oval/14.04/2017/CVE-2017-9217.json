  "description": "systemd-resolved through 233 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) via a crafted DNS response with an empty question section.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2017-9217` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ngir1.2-gudev-1.0 - 204-5ubuntu20.24\nlibgudev-1.0-0 - 204-5ubuntu20.24\nlibpam-systemd - 204-5ubuntu20.24\nlibsystemd-daemon0 - 204-5ubuntu20.24\nlibsystemd-id128-0 - 204-5ubuntu20.24\nlibsystemd-journal0 - 204-5ubuntu20.24\nlibsystemd-login0 - 204-5ubuntu20.24\nlibudev1 - 204-5ubuntu20.24\npython-systemd - 204-5ubuntu20.24\nsystemd - 204-5ubuntu20.24\nsystemd-services - 204-5ubuntu20.24\nudev - 204-5ubuntu20.24\nNo subscription required",
  "note": "tyhicks\u003e I believe that this was introduced in v223 by https://github.com/systemd/systemd/commit/29815b6c608b836cada5e349d06a96b63eaa65f3 Lennart pointed out in the pull request that systemd-resolved is respawned after crashing. Therefore, I've rated this as a low priority. systemd-resolved became the default DNS resolver in Zesty and it is enabled in Yakkety systemd-resolved is not used by default in Xenial. It is spawned if a user execs the systemd-resolve utility but that shouldn't impact the system.",
