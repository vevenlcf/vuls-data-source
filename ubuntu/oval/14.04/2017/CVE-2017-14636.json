  "title": "CVE-2017-14636 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
  "description": "Because of an integer overflow in sam2p 0.49.3, a loop executes 0xffffffff times, ending with an invalid read of size 1 in the Image::Indexed::sortPal function in image.cpp. However, this also causes memory corruption because of an attempted write to the invalid d[0xfffffffe] array element. It was discovered that Sam2p incorrectly handled certain image files. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or other unspecified impact.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2017-14636` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nsam2p - 0.49.2-3+deb8u3build0.14.04.1\nNo subscription required",
