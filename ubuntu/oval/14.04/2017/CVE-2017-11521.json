  "title": "CVE-2017-11521 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
  "description": "The SdpContents::Session::Medium::parse function in resip/stack/SdpContents.cxx in reSIProcate 1.10.2 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by triggering many media connections. Gregor Jasny discovered that reSIProcate incorrectly handled a large number of media connections. A remote attacker could exploit by triggering many media connections to cause reSIProcate to crash, resulting in a denial of service (memory consumption).",
