  "title": "CVE-2017-12839 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
  "description": "A heap-based buffer over-read in the getbits function in src/libmpg123/getbits.h in mpg123 through 1.25.5 allows remote attackers to cause a possible denial-of-service (out-of-bounds read) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted mp3 file. It was discovered that mpg123 failed to handle certain malformed mp3 files. An attacker could use this vulnerability to potentially leak sensitive information or cause a crash.",
