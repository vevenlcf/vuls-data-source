  "description": "The _WM_SetupMidiEvent function in internal_midi.c:2122 in WildMIDI 0.4.2 can cause a denial of service (invalid memory read and application crash) via a crafted mid file. It was discovered that WildMIDI incorrectly handled certain MID files. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service.",
