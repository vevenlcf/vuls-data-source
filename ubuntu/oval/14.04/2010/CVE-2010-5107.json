  "description": "The default configuration of OpenSSH through 6.1 enforces a fixed time limit between establishing a TCP connection and completing a login, which makes it easier for remote attackers to cause a denial of service (connection-slot exhaustion) by periodically making many new TCP connections.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2010-5107` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nopenssh-client - 1:6.1p1-3\nopenssh-server - 1:6.1p1-3\nopenssh-sftp-server - 1:6.1p1-3\nssh - 1:6.1p1-3\nssh-askpass-gnome - 1:6.1p1-3\nssh-krb5 - 1:6.1p1-3\nNo subscription required",
  "note": "jdstrand\u003e this is a long-standing problem with any server that limits connections. This requires conffile changes. mdeslaur\u003e Upstream has changed the default MaxStartups to 10:30:100 to mitigate this issue. Sysadmins can change the equivalent config locally.  we will not be fixing this issue in Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, in environments where this is a concern, we suggest settings the MaxStartups value to 10:30:100 in the sshd_config file",
