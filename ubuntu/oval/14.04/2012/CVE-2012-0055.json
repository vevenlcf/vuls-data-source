  "title": "CVE-2012-0055 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
  "description": "OverlayFS in the Linux kernel before 3.0.0-16.28, as used in Ubuntu 10.0.4 LTS and 11.10, is missing inode security checks which could allow attackers to bypass security restrictions and perform unauthorized actions. Andy Whitcroft discovered a that the Overlayfs filesystem was not doing the extended permission checks needed by cgroups and Linux Security Modules (LSMs). A local user could exploit this to by-pass security policy and access files that should not be accessible.",
