  "description": "tables/apr_hash.c in the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) library through 1.4.5 computes hash values without restricting the ability to trigger hash collisions predictably, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via crafted input to an application that maintains a hash table.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2012-0840` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibapr1 - 1.4.6-1\nNo subscription required",
