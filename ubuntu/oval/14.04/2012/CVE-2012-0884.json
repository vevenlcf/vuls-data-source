  "title": "CVE-2012-0884 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
  "description": "The implementation of Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) and PKCS #7 in OpenSSL before 0.9.8u and 1.x before 1.0.0h does not properly restrict certain oracle behavior, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to decrypt data via a Million Message Attack (MMA) adaptive chosen ciphertext attack.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2012-0884` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibssl1.0.0 - 1.0.1-4ubuntu1\nopenssl - 1.0.1-4ubuntu1\nNo subscription required\n\nlibssl0.9.8 - 0.9.8o-7ubuntu3.2.14.04.1\nNo subscription required",
  "note": "sbeattie\u003e only affects CMS, PKCS #7, or S/MIME decryption, not SSL/TLS transactions mdeslaur\u003e from oss-security: \"If a Linux distribution picks up the fix for CVE-2012-0884 then they will want to pick up change 22161 at the same time since the fix for the security vulnerability will generally cause symmetric decryption errors when it kicks in and things get very confusing for the end user without change 22161\" A second issue was fixed too, see: http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2012/05/11/5",
