  "note": "seth-arnold\u003e The Debian triage mentions two points, first that the upstream fix has been dropped from upstream for unknown reasons; second, Fiddle in Ruby 2.2 has the same problem. MITRE hasn't (yet?) assigned a CVE for 7269e3de3cee3bbb6ab77fc708f3a10cab00b65e but that may be for their own reasons. mdeslaur\u003e DL was removed in 2.2 This is the same issue as CVE-2015-7551, except only for 1.9.1",
