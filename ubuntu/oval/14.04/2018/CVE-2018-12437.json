  "title": "CVE-2018-12437 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
  "description": "LibTomCrypt through 1.18.1 allows a memory-cache side-channel attack on ECDSA signatures, aka the Return Of the Hidden Number Problem or ROHNP. To discover an ECDSA key, the attacker needs access to either the local machine or a different virtual machine on the same physical host. It was discovered that LibTomCrypt incorrectly handled ECDSA signatures. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to obtain sensitive information.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2018-12437` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibtomcrypt0 - 1.17-5ubuntu0.1\nNo subscription required",
