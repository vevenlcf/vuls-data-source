  "title": "CVE-2018-13410 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
  "description": "** DISPUTED ** Info-ZIP Zip 3.0, when the -T and -TT command-line options are used, allows attackers to cause a denial of service (invalid free and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact because of an off-by-one error. NOTE: it is unclear whether there are realistic scenarios in which an untrusted party controls the -TT value, given that the entire purpose of -TT is execution of arbitrary commands.",
  "note": "rodrigo-zaiden\u003e suse does not have plans to fix it and debian marked as negligible. There is no obvious security impact since there is no scenarios where an untrusted party controls the -TT input value. Ubuntu is ignoring it as it is being disputed and there is no update as of 2022-02-01.",
