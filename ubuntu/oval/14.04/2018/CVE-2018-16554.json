  "description": "The ProcessGpsInfo function of the gpsinfo.c file of jhead 3.00 may allow a remote attacker to cause a denial-of-service attack or unspecified other impact via a malicious JPEG file, because of inconsistency between float and double in a sprintf format string during TAG_GPS_ALT handling. It was discovered that jhead did not properly handle certain crafted input. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious JPEG file, a remote attacker could cause jhead to crash.",
