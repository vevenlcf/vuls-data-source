  "description": "An issue was discovered in MP4Box in GPAC 0.7.1. There is a heap-based buffer over-read in the isomedia/box_dump.c function hdlr_dump. It was discovered that the GPAC MP4Box utility incorrectly handled certain memory operations. If an user or automated system were tricked into opening a specially crafted MP4 file, a remote attacker could use this issue to cause MP4Box to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
