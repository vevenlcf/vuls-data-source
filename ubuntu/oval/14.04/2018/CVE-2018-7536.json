  "title": "CVE-2018-7536 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
  "description": "An issue was discovered in Django 2.0 before 2.0.3, 1.11 before 1.11.11, and 1.8 before 1.8.19. The django.utils.html.urlize() function was extremely slow to evaluate certain inputs due to catastrophic backtracking vulnerabilities in two regular expressions (only one regular expression for Django 1.8.x). The urlize() function is used to implement the urlize and urlizetrunc template filters, which were thus vulnerable.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2018-7536` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\npython-django - 1.6.11-0ubuntu1.2\nNo subscription required",
