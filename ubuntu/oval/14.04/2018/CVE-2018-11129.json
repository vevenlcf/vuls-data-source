  "description": "The header::add_INFO_descriptor function in header.cpp in VCFtools 0.1.15 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (use-after-free) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted vcf file. It was discovered that VCFtools improperly handled certain input. If a user was tricked into opening a crafted input file, VCFtools could be made to crash.",
