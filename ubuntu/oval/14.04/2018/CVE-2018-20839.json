  "title": "CVE-2018-20839 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
  "description": "systemd 242 changes the VT1 mode upon a logout, which allows attackers to read cleartext passwords in certain circumstances, such as watching a shutdown, or using Ctrl-Alt-F1 and Ctrl-Alt-F2. This occurs because the KDGKBMODE (aka current keyboard mode) check is mishandled.",
  "note": "seth-arnold\u003e Possible regression when running startx manually mdeslaur\u003e commit was reverted in (240-6ubuntu7)  possibly a bug in plymouth, not systemd as of 2021-04-12, we can no longer reproduce this issue with all updates applied. I am therefore marking this CVE as not affecting systemd and closing it out. This was possibly fixed by the plymouth change in bug 1817738.",
