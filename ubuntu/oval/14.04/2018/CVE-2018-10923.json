  "title": "CVE-2018-10923 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
  "description": "It was found that the \"mknod\" call derived from mknod(2) can create files pointing to devices on a glusterfs server node. An authenticated attacker could use this to create an arbitrary device and read data from any device attached to the glusterfs server node. It was discovered that GlusterFS incorrectly handled file creation. An authenticated attacker could possibly use this issue to create arbitrary files and obtain sensitive information.",
