  "title": "CVE-2018-6360 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
  "description": "mpv through 0.28.0 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted web site, because it reads HTML documents containing VIDEO elements, and accepts arbitrary URLs in a src attribute without a protocol whitelist in player/lua/ytdl_hook.lua. For example, an av://lavfi:ladspa=file= URL signifies that the product should call dlopen on a shared object file located at an arbitrary local pathname. The issue exists because the product does not consider that youtube-dl can provide a potentially unsafe URL.",
