  "title": "CVE-2018-15607 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
  "description": "In ImageMagick 7.0.8-11 Q16, a tiny input file 0x50 0x36 0x36 0x36 0x36 0x4c 0x36 0x38 0x36 0x36 0x36 0x36 0x36 0x36 0x1f 0x35 0x50 0x00 can result in a hang of several minutes during which CPU and memory resources are consumed until ultimately an attempted large memory allocation fails. Remote attackers could leverage this vulnerability to cause a denial of service via a crafted file.",
  "note": "sbeattie\u003e no code fix upstream, solution is to limit sizes allowed in policy.xml file some resource limits were not in place until 2018; e.g. 00097eb42c2ea812d4a26e6683b000d4354f5fad 4d0ac66c9778faebd2d1fac7140462b043626458 1aea20aa815c41e9e2edbebb09fcdedfec064c89 60658b89de660ce8f5a2e795a0a76d3755bcef15 4493d9ca1124564da17f9b628ef9d0f1a6be9738 b8e26639f76b2e9f965584106a6819ee1d50095b 740985d9bd3f1c50d622c3496bb2e75d44b65a91 (CVE-2017-18028) bionic and newer versions have policy limits in place by default that prevent the issue mdeslaur\u003e adding this commit to bionic causes test failures, need to investigate further.",
