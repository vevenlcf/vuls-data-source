  "title": "CVE-2018-16585 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
  "description": "** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in Artifex Ghostscript before 9.24. The .setdistillerkeys PostScript command is accepted even though it is not intended for use during document processing (e.g., after the startup phase). This leads to memory corruption, allowing remote attackers able to supply crafted PostScript to crash the interpreter or possibly have unspecified other impact. Note: A reputable source believes that the CVE is potentially a duplicate of CVE-2018-15910 as explained in Red Hat bugzilla (https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1626193).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2018-16585` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nghostscript - 9.10~dfsg-0ubuntu10.13\nghostscript-x - 9.10~dfsg-0ubuntu10.13\nlibgs9 - 9.10~dfsg-0ubuntu10.13\nlibgs9-common - 9.10~dfsg-0ubuntu10.13\nNo subscription required",
