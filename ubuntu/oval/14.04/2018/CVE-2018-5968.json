  "title": "CVE-2018-5968 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - medium.",
  "description": "FasterXML jackson-databind through 2.8.11 and 2.9.x through 2.9.3 allows unauthenticated remote code execution because of an incomplete fix for the CVE-2017-7525 and CVE-2017-17485 deserialization flaws. This is exploitable via two different gadgets that bypass a blacklist. It was discovered that Jackson Databind incorrectly handled deserialization. An attacker could possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary code.",
