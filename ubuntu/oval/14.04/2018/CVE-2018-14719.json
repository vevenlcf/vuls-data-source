  "description": "FasterXML jackson-databind 2.x before 2.9.7 might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by leveraging failure to block the blaze-ds-opt and blaze-ds-core classes from polymorphic deserialization. It was discovered that Jackson Databind incorrectly handled deserialization. An attacker could possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary code or other unspecified impact.",
