  "title": "CVE-2018-21029 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (trusty) - low.",
  "description": "** DISPUTED ** systemd 239 through 245 accepts any certificate signed by a trusted certificate authority for DNS Over TLS. Server Name Indication (SNI) is not sent, and there is no hostname validation with the GnuTLS backend. NOTE: This has been disputed by the developer as not a vulnerability since hostname validation does not have anything to do with this issue (i.e. there is no hostname to be sent).",
  "note": "mdeslaur\u003e DNS over TLS not enabled by default in Ubuntu. this is only an issue in v243 because strict mode got introduced (DNSOverTLS=yes). Versions earlier than 243 only implemented opportunistic mode which, according to specs, might or not validate the resolver and can also be downgraded.",
