  "description": "Heap-based buffer overflow in the yy_get_next_buffer function in Flex before 2.6.1 might allow context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code via vectors involving num_to_read.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2016-6354` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nflex - 2.6.1-1\nlibfl2 - 2.6.1-1\nNo subscription required",
  "note": "mdeslaur\u003e introduced in 2.5.36 by https://github.com/westes/flex/commit/9ba3187a537d6a58d345f2874d06087fd4050399 sbeattie\u003e redhat bug claims that it's not exploitable due to followup code also, simply replacing yy_size_t with int on num_to_read as in the upstream patch causes even more signed comparison warnings in flex generated sources; there's a comparison against a size_t variable in YY_INPUT for one. The \"correct\" fix for this likely includes the additional commit mentioned in the oss-security post. fixing will also require recompiling anything with generated code from the versions of flex in vivid through xenial.",
