  "description": "Monitorix 3.13.0 allows remote attackers to bypass Basic Authentication in a default installation (i.e., an installation without a hosts_deny option). This issue occurred because a new access-control feature was introduced without considering that some exiting installations became unsafe, upon an update to 3.13.0, unless the new feature was immediately configured.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2021-3325` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nmonitorix - 3.12.0-1\nNo subscription required",
