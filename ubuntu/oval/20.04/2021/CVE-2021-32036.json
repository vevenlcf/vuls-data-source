  "title": "CVE-2021-32036 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (focal) - medium.",
  "description": "An authenticated user without any specific authorizations may be able to repeatedly invoke the features command where at a high volume may lead to resource depletion or generate high lock contention. This may result in denial of service and in rare cases could result in id field collisions.",
  "note": "sbeattie\u003e the `oidReset` command implementation has existed in a couple of different locations in mongodb history, in src/mongo/db/commands/generic.cpp during 3.6.x and src/mongo/db/dbcommands_generic.cpp in 2.x timeframe. All of those implementations of `oidReset` lack an authorization requirement. all of the upstream commits for this issue are on branches licensed under mongodb's SSPL, which makes backporting them to GNU Affero licensed versions problematic.",
