  "title": "CVE-2021-40528 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (focal) - medium.",
  "description": "The ElGamal implementation in Libgcrypt before 1.9.4 allows plaintext recovery because, during interaction between two cryptographic libraries, a certain dangerous combination of the prime defined by the receiver's public key, the generator defined by the receiver's public key, and the sender's ephemeral exponents can lead to a cross-configuration attack against OpenPGP.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2021-40528` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibgcrypt20 - 1.8.5-5ubuntu1.1\nNo subscription required",
