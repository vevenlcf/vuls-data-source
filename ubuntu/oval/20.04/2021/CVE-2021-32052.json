  "title": "CVE-2021-32052 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (focal) - medium.",
  "description": "In Django 2.2 before 2.2.22, 3.1 before 3.1.10, and 3.2 before 3.2.2 (with Python 3.9.5+), URLValidator does not prohibit newlines and tabs (unless the URLField form field is used). If an application uses values with newlines in an HTTP response, header injection can occur. Django itself is unaffected because HttpResponse prohibits newlines in HTTP headers.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2021-32052` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\npython3-django - 2:2.2.12-1ubuntu0.7\nNo subscription required",
  "note": "amurray\u003e Requires Python 3.9.5 or greater which is only present in impish+ mdeslaur\u003e Python 3.9.5 is now being backported to focal+, so this now needs to be fixed While this was originally marked as not-affected for bionic, a subsequent security update introduced the behaviour change in bionic which resulted in this CVE needing to be fixed.",
