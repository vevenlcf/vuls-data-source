  "title": "CVE-2017-18196 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (focal) - low.",
  "description": "Leptonica 1.74.4 constructs unintended pathnames (containing duplicated path components) when operating on files in /tmp subdirectories, which might allow local users to bypass intended file restrictions by leveraging access to a directory located deeper within the /tmp directory tree, as demonstrated by /tmp/ANY/PATH/ANY/PATH/input.tif. It was discovered that Leptonica incorrectly handled path names. An attacker could possibly use this issue to obtain sensitive information.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2017-18196` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nleptonica-progs - 1.75.3-2\nliblept5 - 1.75.3-2\nNo subscription required",
