  "title": "CVE-2017-16129 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (focal) - medium.",
  "description": "The HTTP client module superagent is vulnerable to ZIP bomb attacks. In a ZIP bomb attack, the HTTP server replies with a compressed response that becomes several magnitudes larger once uncompressed. If a client does not take special care when processing such responses, it may result in excessive CPU and/or memory consumption. An attacker might exploit such a weakness for a DoS attack. To exploit this the attacker must control the location (URL) that superagent makes a request to.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2017-16129` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nnode-superagent - 5.2.2-1\nNo subscription required",
