  "description": "Vulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded, JRockit component of Oracle Java SE (subcomponent: Libraries). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 6u171, 7u161, 8u152 and 9.0.1; Java SE Embedded: 8u151; JRockit: R28.3.16. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded, JRockit. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability to cause a partial denial of service (partial DOS) of Java SE, Java SE Embedded, JRockit. Note: This vulnerability applies to client and server deployment of Java. This vulnerability can be exploited through sandboxed Java Web Start applications and sandboxed Java applets. It can also be exploited by supplying data to APIs in the specified Component without using sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, such as through a web service. CVSS 3.0 Base Score 4.3 (Availability impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L). It was discovered that in some situations OpenJDK did not properly validate objects when performing deserialization. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (application crash or excessive memory consumption).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2018-2663` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nopenjdk-8-demo - 8u162-b12-1\nopenjdk-8-jdk - 8u162-b12-1\nopenjdk-8-jdk-headless - 8u162-b12-1\nopenjdk-8-jre - 8u162-b12-1\nopenjdk-8-jre-headless - 8u162-b12-1\nopenjdk-8-jre-zero - 8u162-b12-1\nopenjdk-8-source - 8u162-b12-1\nNo subscription required",
