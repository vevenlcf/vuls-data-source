  "title": "CVE-2018-16471 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (focal) - medium.",
  "description": "There is a possible XSS vulnerability in Rack before 2.0.6 and 1.6.11. Carefully crafted requests can impact the data returned by the `scheme` method on `Rack::Request`. Applications that expect the scheme to be limited to 'http' or 'https' and do not escape the return value could be vulnerable to an XSS attack. Note that applications using the normal escaping mechanisms provided by Rails may not impacted, but applications that bypass the escaping mechanisms, or do not use them may be vulnerable. It was discovered that Rack incorrectly handled carefully crafted requests. A remote attacker could use this issue to execute a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2018-16471` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nruby-rack - 2.0.6-3\nNo subscription required",
