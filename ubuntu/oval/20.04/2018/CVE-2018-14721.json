  "title": "CVE-2018-14721 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (focal) - medium.",
  "description": "FasterXML jackson-databind 2.x before 2.9.7 might allow remote attackers to conduct server-side request forgery (SSRF) attacks by leveraging failure to block the axis2-jaxws class from polymorphic deserialization. It was discovered that Jackson Databind incorrectly handled deserialization. An attacker could possibly use this issue to execute server-side request forgery (SSRF).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2018-14721` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibjackson2-databind-java - 2.9.7\nNo subscription required",
