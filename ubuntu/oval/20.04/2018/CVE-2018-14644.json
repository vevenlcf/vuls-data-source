  "description": "An issue has been found in PowerDNS Recursor from 4.0.0 up to and including 4.1.4. A remote attacker sending a DNS query for a meta-type like OPT can lead to a zone being wrongly cached as failing DNSSEC validation. It only arises if the parent zone is signed, and all the authoritative servers for that parent zone answer with FORMERR to a query for at least one of the meta-types. As a result, subsequent queries from clients requesting DNSSEC validation will be answered with a ServFail.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2018-14644` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\npdns-recursor - 4.2.0-6\nNo subscription required",
