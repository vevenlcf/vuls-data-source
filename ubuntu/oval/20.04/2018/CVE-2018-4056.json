  "title": "CVE-2018-4056 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (focal) - medium.",
  "description": "An exploitable SQL injection vulnerability exists in the administrator web portal function of coTURN prior to version 4.5.0.9. A login message with a specially crafted username can cause an SQL injection, resulting in authentication bypass, which could give access to the TURN server administrator web portal. An attacker can log in via the external interface of the TURN server to trigger this vulnerability.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2018-4056` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ncoturn - 4.5.1.1-1.1build1\nNo subscription required",
  "note": "ebarretto\u003e As the administration web interface is shared with the production, it is unfortunately not possible to easily filter outside access and this security update completely disable the web interface. Users should use the local, command line interface instead.",
