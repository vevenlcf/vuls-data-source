  "description": "The Onion module in toxcore before 0.2.2 doesn't restrict which packets can be onion-routed, which allows a remote attacker to discover a target user's IP address (when knowing only their Tox Id) by positioning themselves close to target's Tox Id in the DHT for the target to establish an onion connection with the attacker, guessing the target's DHT public key and creating a DHT node with public key close to it, and finally onion-routing a NAT Ping Request to the target, requesting it to ping the just created DHT node.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2018-25022` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibtoxcore2 - 0.2.10-1build2\ntoxcore-utils - 0.2.10-1build2\nNo subscription required",
