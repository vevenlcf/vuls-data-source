  "title": "CVE-2018-7186 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (focal) - medium.",
  "description": "Leptonica before 1.75.3 does not limit the number of characters in a %s format argument to fscanf or sscanf, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (stack-based buffer overflow) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a long string, as demonstrated by the gplotRead and ptaReadStream functions. It was discovered that Leptonica incorrectly handled input arguments. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or other unspecified impact.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2018-7186` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nleptonica-progs - 1.75.3-2\nliblept5 - 1.75.3-2\nNo subscription required",
