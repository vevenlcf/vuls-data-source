  "description": "An exploitable arbitrary memory read vulnerability exists in the MQTT packet-parsing functionality of Cesanta Mongoose 6.13. It is a heap-based buffer over-read in mg_mqtt_next_subscribe_topic. A specially crafted MQTT SUBSCRIBE packet can cause an arbitrary out-of-bounds memory read potentially resulting in information disclosure and denial of service. An attacker needs to send a specially crafted MQTT packet over the network to trigger this vulnerability.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2018-18765` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nsmplayer - 19.10.2~ds0-1build1\nsmplayer-l10n - 19.10.2~ds0-1build1\nNo subscription required",
