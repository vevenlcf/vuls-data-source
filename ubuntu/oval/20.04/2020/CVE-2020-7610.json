  "description": "All versions of bson before 1.1.4 are vulnerable to Deserialization of Untrusted Data. The package will ignore an unknown value for an object's _bsotype, leading to cases where an object is serialized as a document rather than the intended BSON type.",
  "note": "seth-arnold\u003e The github patch link from snyk.io shows a diff with 'serializer.js', but the description is for Deserialization. I don't know if this is intentoinal or not.",
