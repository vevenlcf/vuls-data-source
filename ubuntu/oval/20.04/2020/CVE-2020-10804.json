  "description": "In phpMyAdmin 4.x before 4.9.5 and 5.x before 5.0.2, a SQL injection vulnerability was found in retrieval of the current username (in libraries/classes/Server/Privileges.php and libraries/classes/UserPassword.php). A malicious user with access to the server could create a crafted username, and then trick the victim into performing specific actions with that user account (such as editing its privileges). It was discovered that phpMyAdmin failed to sanitize certain input. An attacker could use this vulnerability to execute an SQL injection attack via a specially crafted username.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2020-10804` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nphpmyadmin - 4:4.9.5+dfsg1-1ubuntu1\nNo subscription required",
