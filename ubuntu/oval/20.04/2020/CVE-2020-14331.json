  "title": "CVE-2020-14331 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (focal) - negligible.",
  "description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernelâ€™s implementation of the invert video code on VGA consoles when a local attacker attempts to resize the console, calling an ioctl VT_RESIZE, which causes an out-of-bounds write to occur. This flaw allows a local user with access to the VGA console to crash the system, potentially escalating their privileges on the system. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.",
  "note": "amurray\u003e CONFIG_VGACON_SOFT_SCROLLBACK is required to be enabled for this to be exploitable. This config option is disabled in Ubuntu kernel configs.",
