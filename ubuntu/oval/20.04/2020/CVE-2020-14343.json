  "title": "CVE-2020-14343 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (focal) - medium.",
  "description": "A vulnerability was discovered in the PyYAML library in versions before 5.4, where it is susceptible to arbitrary code execution when it processes untrusted YAML files through the full_load method or with the FullLoader loader. Applications that use the library to process untrusted input may be vulnerable to this flaw. This flaw allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system by abusing the python/object/new constructor. This flaw is due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2020-1747.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2020-14343` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\npython-yaml - 5.3.1-1ubuntu0.1\npython3-yaml - 5.3.1-1ubuntu0.1\nNo subscription required",
