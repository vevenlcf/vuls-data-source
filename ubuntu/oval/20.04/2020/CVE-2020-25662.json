  "description": "A Red Hat only CVE-2020-12352 regression issue was found in the way the Linux kernel's Bluetooth stack implementation handled the initialization of stack memory when handling certain AMP packets. This flaw allows a remote attacker in an adjacent range to leak small portions of stack memory on the system by sending specially crafted AMP packets.
