  "description": "An issue was discovered in function latm_write_packet in libavformat/latmenc.c in Ffmpeg 4.2.1, allows attackers to cause a Denial of Service or other unspecified impacts due to a Null pointer dereference.",
  "note": "ccdm94\u003e Xenial seems to not be vulnerable to this issue. The commit that introduces the code addressed in the fix commit (dd01947397b) is 8b3ec51de8a (3.4). In this commit, the lines that were added in the fix were removed. The package code in Xenial does not include the changes added by 8b3ec51de8a, and therefore, code reintroduced by the fix to this CVE is already present.",
