  "title": "CVE-2020-15900 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (focal) - medium.",
  "description": "A memory corruption issue was found in Artifex Ghostscript 9.50 and 9.52. Use of a non-standard PostScript operator can allow overriding of file access controls. The 'rsearch' calculation for the 'post' size resulted in a size that was too large, and could underflow to max uint32_t. This was fixed in commit 5d499272b95a6b890a1397e11d20937de000d31b.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2020-15900` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nghostscript - 9.50~dfsg-5ubuntu4.1\nghostscript-x - 9.50~dfsg-5ubuntu4.1\nlibgs9 - 9.50~dfsg-5ubuntu4.1\nlibgs9-common - 9.50~dfsg-5ubuntu4.1\nNo subscription required",
