  "description": "Vulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded product of Oracle Java SE (component: Networking). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 7u241 and 8u231; Java SE Embedded: 8u231. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability to cause a partial denial of service (partial DOS) of Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets (in Java SE 8), that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability can also be exploited by using APIs in the specified Component, e.g., through a web service which supplies data to the APIs. CVSS 3.0 Base Score 3.7 (Availability impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L). It was discovered that OpenJDK incorrectly enforced the limit of datagram sockets that can be created by a code running within Java sandbox. An attacker could possibly use this issue to bypass the sandbox restrictions causing a denial of service. This issue only affected OpenJDK 8.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2020-2659` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nopenjdk-8-demo - 8u242-b08-0ubuntu3\nopenjdk-8-jdk - 8u242-b08-0ubuntu3\nopenjdk-8-jdk-headless - 8u242-b08-0ubuntu3\nopenjdk-8-jre - 8u242-b08-0ubuntu3\nopenjdk-8-jre-headless - 8u242-b08-0ubuntu3\nopenjdk-8-jre-zero - 8u242-b08-0ubuntu3\nopenjdk-8-source - 8u242-b08-0ubuntu3\nNo subscription required",
