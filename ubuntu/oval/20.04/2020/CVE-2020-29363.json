A heap-based buffer overflow has been discovered in the RPC protocol used by p11-kit server/remote commands and the client library.

The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibp11-kit0 - 0.23.20-1ubuntu0.1\np11-kit - 0.23.20-1ubuntu0.1\np11-kit-modules - 0.23.20-1ubuntu0.1\nNo subscription required",
