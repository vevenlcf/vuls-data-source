  "title": "CVE-2020-26939 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (focal) - low.",
  "description": "In Legion of the Bouncy Castle BC before 1.61 and BC-FJA before 1.0.1.2, attackers can obtain sensitive information about a private exponent because of Observable Differences in Behavior to Error Inputs. This occurs in org.bouncycastle.crypto.encodings.OAEPEncoding. Sending invalid ciphertext that decrypts to a short payload in the OAEP Decoder could result in the throwing of an early exception, potentially leaking some information about the private exponent of the RSA private key performing the encryption.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2020-26939` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibbcmail-java - 1.61-1\nlibbcpg-java - 1.61-1\nlibbcpkix-java - 1.61-1\nlibbcprov-java - 1.61-1\nNo subscription required",
