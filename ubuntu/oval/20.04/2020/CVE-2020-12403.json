  "title": "CVE-2020-12403 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (focal) - medium.",
  "description": "A flaw was found in the way CHACHA20-POLY1305 was implemented in NSS in versions before 3.55. When using multi-part Chacha20, it could cause out-of-bounds reads. This issue was fixed by explicitly disabling multi-part ChaCha20 (which was not functioning correctly) and strictly enforcing tag length. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality and system availability.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2020-12403` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibnss3 - 2:3.49.1-1ubuntu1.5\nlibnss3-tools - 2:3.49.1-1ubuntu1.5\nNo subscription required",
