  "title": "CVE-2020-10543 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (focal) - low.",
  "description": "Perl before 5.30.3 on 32-bit platforms allows a heap-based buffer overflow because nested regular expression quantifiers have an integer overflow.  An application written in Perl would only be vulnerable to this flaw if  it evaluates regular expressions supplied by the attacker. Evaluating  regular expressions in this fashion is known to be dangerous since the  regular expression engine does not protect against denial of service  attacks in this usage scenario.  Additionally, the target system needs a sufficient amount of memory to  allocate partial expansions of the nested quantifiers prior to the  overflow occurring. This requirement is unlikely to be met on 64bit  systems.]\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2020-10543` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibperl5.30 - 5.30.0-9ubuntu0.2\nperl - 5.30.0-9ubuntu0.2\nperl-base - 5.30.0-9ubuntu0.2\nperl-debug - 5.30.0-9ubuntu0.2\nperl-modules-5.30 - 5.30.0-9ubuntu0.2\nNo subscription required",
