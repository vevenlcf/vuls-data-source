  "title": "CVE-2020-8631 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (focal) - low.",
  "description": "cloud-init through 19.4 relies on Mersenne Twister for a random password, which makes it easier for attackers to predict passwords, because rand_str in cloudinit/util.py calls the random.choice function.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2020-8631` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ncloud-init - 20.1-10-g71af48df-0ubuntu5\nNo subscription required",
  "note": "ccdm94\u003e This CVE has been patched in Xenial ESM. The patch, however, has been added only to the updates pocket, and since cloud-init is only used during first boot (pulling from updates), there should not be a need to add this to the security pocket.",
