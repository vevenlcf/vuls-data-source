  "title": "CVE-2019-9518 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (focal) - medium.",
  "description": "Some HTTP/2 implementations are vulnerable to a flood of empty frames, potentially leading to a denial of service. The attacker sends a stream of frames with an empty payload and without the end-of-stream flag. These frames can be DATA, HEADERS, CONTINUATION and/or PUSH_PROMISE. The peer spends time processing each frame disproportionate to attack bandwidth. This can consume excess CPU. It was discovered that Netty incorrectly implements HTTP/2. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2019-9518` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\ntrafficserver - 8.0.5+ds-3\ntrafficserver-experimental-plugins - 8.0.5+ds-3\nNo subscription required",
