  "title": "CVE-2019-12213 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (focal) - medium.",
  "description": "When FreeImage 3.18.0 reads a special TIFF file, the TIFFReadDirectory function in PluginTIFF.cpp always returns 1, leading to stack exhaustion. It was discovered that FreeImage incorrectly processed images under certain circumstances. If a user were tricked into opening a crafted TIFF file, a remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a stack exhaustion condition, resulting in a denial of service attack.",
