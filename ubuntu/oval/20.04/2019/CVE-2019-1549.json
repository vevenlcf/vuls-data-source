  "title": "CVE-2019-1549 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (focal) - low.",
  "description": "OpenSSL 1.1.1 introduced a rewritten random number generator (RNG). This was intended to include protection in the event of a fork() system call in order to ensure that the parent and child processes did not share the same RNG state. However this protection was not being used in the default case. A partial mitigation for this issue is that the output from a high precision timer is mixed into the RNG state so the likelihood of a parent and child process sharing state is significantly reduced. If an application already calls OPENSSL_init_crypto() explicitly using OPENSSL_INIT_ATFORK then this problem does not occur at all. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1d (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1c).\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2019-1549` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\novmf - 0~20191122.bd85bf54-2\nqemu-efi - 0~20191122.bd85bf54-2\nqemu-efi-aarch64 - 0~20191122.bd85bf54-2\nqemu-efi-arm - 0~20191122.bd85bf54-2\nNo subscription required\n\nlibssl1.1 - 1.1.1d-2ubuntu1\nopenssl - 1.1.1d-2ubuntu1\nNo subscription required",
