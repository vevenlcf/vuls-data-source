  "title": "CVE-2019-6109 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (focal) - medium.",
  "description": "An issue was discovered in OpenSSH 7.9. Due to missing character encoding in the progress display, a malicious server (or Man-in-The-Middle attacker) can employ crafted object names to manipulate the client output, e.g., by using ANSI control codes to hide additional files being transferred. This affects refresh_progress_meter() in progressmeter.c.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2019-6109` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nopenssh-client - 1:7.9p1-6\nopenssh-server - 1:7.9p1-6\nopenssh-sftp-server - 1:7.9p1-6\nopenssh-tests - 1:7.9p1-6\nssh - 1:7.9p1-6\nssh-askpass-gnome - 1:7.9p1-6\nNo subscription required",
  "note": "seth-arnold\u003e openssh-ssh1 is provided for compatibility with old devices that cannot be upgraded to modern protocols. Thus we may not provide security support for this package if doing so would prevent access to equipment. mdeslaur\u003e The recommended workaround for this issue is to switch to using sftp instead of scp.  The updates in USN-3885-1 inverted two CVE numbers by accident.",
