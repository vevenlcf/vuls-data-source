  "title": "CVE-2019-13619 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (focal) - medium.",
  "description": "In Wireshark 3.0.0 to 3.0.2, 2.6.0 to 2.6.9, and 2.4.0 to 2.4.15, the ASN.1 BER dissector and related dissectors could crash. This was addressed in epan/asn1.c by properly restricting buffer increments. It was discovered that Wireshark improperly handled certain input. A remote or local attacker could cause Wireshark to crash by injecting malformed packets onto the wire or convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace file.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2019-13619` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibwireshark-data - 3.0.3-1\nlibwireshark13 - 3.0.3-1\nlibwiretap10 - 3.0.3-1\nlibwsutil11 - 3.0.3-1\ntshark - 3.0.3-1\nwireshark - 3.0.3-1\nwireshark-common - 3.0.3-1\nwireshark-gtk - 3.0.3-1\nwireshark-qt - 3.0.3-1\nNo subscription required",
