  "title": "CVE-2019-16770 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (focal) - medium.",
  "description": "In Puma before versions 3.12.2 and 4.3.1, a poorly-behaved client could use keepalive requests to monopolize Puma's reactor and create a denial of service attack. If more keepalive connections to Puma are opened than there are threads available, additional connections will wait permanently if the attacker sends requests frequently enough. This vulnerability is patched in Puma 4.3.1 and 3.12.2.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2019-16770` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\npuma - 3.12.0-4ubuntu1\nNo subscription required",
