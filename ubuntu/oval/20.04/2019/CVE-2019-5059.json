An attacker can display a specially crafted image to trigger this vulnerability.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2019-5059` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nlibsdl2-image-2.0-0 - 2.0.5+dfsg1-1\nNo subscription required",
