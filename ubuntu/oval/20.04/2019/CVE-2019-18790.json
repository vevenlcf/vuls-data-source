  "title": "CVE-2019-18790 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (focal) - medium.",
  "description": "An issue was discovered in channels/chan_sip.c in Sangoma Asterisk 13.x before 13.29.2, 16.x before 16.6.2, and 17.x before 17.0.1, and Certified Asterisk 13.21 before cert5. A SIP request can be sent to Asterisk that can change a SIP peer's IP address. A REGISTER does not need to occur, and calls can be hijacked as a result. The only thing that needs to be known is the peer's name; authentication details such as passwords do not need to be known. This vulnerability is only exploitable when the nat option is set to the default, or auto_force_rport.",
