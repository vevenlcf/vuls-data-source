  "title": "CVE-2019-12521 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (focal) - medium.",
  "description": "An issue was discovered in Squid through 4.7. When Squid is parsing ESI, it keeps the ESI elements in ESIContext. ESIContext contains a buffer for holding a stack of ESIElements. When a new ESIElement is parsed, it is added via addStackElement. addStackElement has a check for the number of elements in this buffer, but it's off by 1, leading to a Heap Overflow of 1 element. The overflow is within the same structure so it can't affect adjacent memory blocks, and thus just leads to a crash while processing.\n\nUpdate Instructions:\n\nRun `sudo ua fix CVE-2019-12521` to fix the vulnerability. The problem can be corrected\nby updating your system to the following package versions:\n\nsquid - 4.10-1ubuntu1.1\nsquid-cgi - 4.10-1ubuntu1.1\nsquid-common - 4.10-1ubuntu1.1\nsquid-purge - 4.10-1ubuntu1.1\nsquidclient - 4.10-1ubuntu1.1\nNo subscription required",
