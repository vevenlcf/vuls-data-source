In the best case this leads\n\t    to wrong TLS extensions being used for the client, worst-case a\n\t    crash of the proxy terminating all active transactions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eIncorrect message size checks and assumptions about the existence\n\t    of TLS extensions in the SSL/TLS handshake message can lead to very\n\t    high CPU consumption (up to and including 'infinite loop'\n\t    behaviour).\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eThe above can be triggered remotely. Though there is one layer of\n\t    authorization applied before this processing to check that the\n\t    client is allowed to use the proxy, that check is generally weak. MS\n\t    Skype on Windows XP is known to trigger some of these.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\t\u003cp\u003eThe FreeBSD port does not use SSL by default and is not vulnerable\n\t  in the default configuration.\u003c/p\u003e\n      ",
