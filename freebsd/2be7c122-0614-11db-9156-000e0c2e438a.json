  "description": "\n\t\u003cp\u003eAndreas Seltenreich reports that hashcash is prone to a heap\n\t  overflow vulnerability.  This vulnerability is caused by\n\t  improper checking of memory allocations within the\n\t  \"array_push()\" function.  An attacker could trigger this\n\t  vulnerability by passing a lot of \"-r\" or \"-j\" flags from\n\t  the command line, this only applies when the application is\n\t  configured to allow command line options, or by passing a lot\n\t  of resource names when the application was started with the\n\t  \"-m\" flag set.  This could lead to a Denial or Service or\n\t  could allow remote access to the targeted system.\u003c/p\u003e\n      ",
