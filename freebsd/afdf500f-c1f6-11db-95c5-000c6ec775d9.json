  "description": "\n\t\u003cp\u003eA IBM Internet Security Systems Protection Advisory\n\t  reports:\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003cblockquote cite=\"http://iss.net/threats/257.html\"\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eSnort is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow as a\n\t    result of DCE/RPC reassembly. This vulnerability is in a\n\t    dynamic-preprocessor enabled in the default configuration,\n\t    and the configuration for this preprocessor allows for\n\t    auto-recognition of SMB traffic to perform reassembly\n\t    on. No checks are performed to see if the traffic is part\n\t    of a valid TCP session, and multiple Write AndX requests\n\t    can be chained in the same TCP segment. As a result, an\n\t    attacker can exploit this overflow with a single TCP PDU\n\t    sent across a network monitored by Snort or Sourcefire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eSnort users who cannot upgrade immediately are advised to\n\t    disable the DCE/RPC preprocessor by removing the DCE/RPC\n\t    preprocessor directives from snort.conf and restarting\n\t    Snort. However, be advised that disabling the DCE/RPC\n\t    preprocessor reduces detection capabilities for attacks in\n\t    DCE/RPC traffic. After upgrading, customers should\n\t    re-enable the DCE/RPC preprocessor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
