This could be used as part of a phishing\n\t      attack. These releases fix this problem by introducing a new\n\t      setting, ALLOWED_HOSTS, which specifies a whitelist of domains your\n\t      site is known to respond to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t    \u003cp\u003eImportant: by default Django 1.3.6 and 1.4.4 set ALLOWED_HOSTS to\n\t      allow all hosts. This means that to actually fix the security\n\t      vulnerability you should define this setting yourself immediately\n\t      after upgrading.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003c/li\u003e\n\t  \u003cli\u003e\n\t    \u003cp\u003eFormset denial-of-service\u003c/p\u003e\n\t    \u003cp\u003ean attacker can abuse Django's tracking of the number of forms in\n\t      a formset to cause a denial-of-service attack. This has been fixed\n\t      by adding a default maximum number of forms of 1,000. You can still\n\t      manually specify a bigger max_num, if you wish, but 1,000 should be\n\t      enough for anyone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003c/li\u003e\n\t  \u003cli\u003e\n\t    \u003cp\u003eXML attacks\u003c/p\u003e\n\t    \u003cp\u003eDjango's serialization framework was vulnerable to attacks via XML\n\t      entity expansion and external references; this is now fixed.\n\t      However, if you're parsing arbitrary XML in other parts of your\n\t      application, we recommend you look into the defusedxml Python\n\t      packages which remedy this anywhere you parse XML, not just via\n\t      Django's serialization framework.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003c/li\u003e\n\t  \u003cli\u003e\n\t    \u003cp\u003eData leakage via admin history log\u003c/p\u003e\n\t    \u003cp\u003eDjango's admin interface could expose supposedly-hidden\n\t      information via its history log. This has been fixed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003c/li\u003e\n\t  \u003c/ol\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
