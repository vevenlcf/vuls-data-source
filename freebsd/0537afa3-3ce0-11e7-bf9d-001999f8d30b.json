  "description": "\n\t\u003cp\u003eThe Asterisk project reports:\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003cblockquote cite=\"http://www.asterisk.org/downloads/security-advisories\"\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eA remote crash can be triggered by sending a SIP packet\n\t  to Asterisk with a specially crafted CSeq header and a\n\t  Via header with no branch parameter. The issue is that\n\t  the PJSIP RFC 2543 transaction key generation algorithm\n\t  does not allocate a large enough buffer. By overrunning\n\t  the buffer, the memory allocation table becomes corrupted,\n\t  leading to an eventual crash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eThe multi-part body parser in PJSIP contains a logical\n\t  error that can make certain multi-part body parts attempt\n\t  to read memory from outside the allowed boundaries. A\n\t  specially-crafted packet can trigger these invalid reads\n\t  and potentially induce a crash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eThis issues is in PJSIP, and so the issue can be fixed\n\t  without performing an upgrade of Asterisk at all. However,\n\t  we are releasing a new version of Asterisk with the bundled\n\t  PJProject updated to include the fix.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eIf you are running Asterisk with chan_sip, this issue\n\t  does not affect you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
