However, the RFCs do not require\n\t    and BIND does not enforce that an asterisk character be present\n\t    only at a terminal node.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eA problem can occur when an asterisk is present in an empty\n\t    non-terminal location within the DNS graph. If such a node exists,\n\t    after a series of queries, named can reach an inconsistent state\n\t    that results in the failure of an assertion check in rbtdb.c,\n\t    followed by the program exiting due to the assertion failure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
