Earlier vulnerabilities in PHP's unserialize()\n\t    that were also discovered by one of our audits in December\n\t    2004 are unrelated to the newly discovered flaw, but they\n\t    have shown, that the unserialize() function is exposed to\n\t    user-input in many popular PHP applications.  Examples for\n\t    applications that use the content of COOKIE variables with\n\t    unserialize() are phpBB and Serendipity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eThe successful exploitation of this integer overflow will\n\t    result in arbitrary code execution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
