  "topic": "newspost -- server response buffer overflow vulnerability",
  "description": "\n      \u003cp\u003eThe newspost program uses a function named socket_getline to read\n\tserver responses from the network socket. Unfortunately this function\n\tdoes not check the length of the buffer in which the read data is stored\n\tand only stops reading when a newline character is found.\u003c/p\u003e\n      \u003cp\u003eA malicious NNTP server could use this bug to cause a buffer overflow\n\tby sending an overly long response. Such an overflow allows arbitrary\n\tcode to be executed, with the privileges of the newspost process, on the\n\taffected systems.\u003c/p\u003e\n    ",
