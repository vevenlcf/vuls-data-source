While FreeBSD may not be\n\tvulnerable to that exact attack, we have identified several\n\tplaces where inadequate DoS protection could allow an\n\tattacker to consume system resources.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003cp\u003eIt is not necessary that the attacker be able to establish\n\ttwo-way communication to carry out these attacks. These\n\tattacks impact both IPv4 and IPv6 fragment reassembly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003ch1\u003eImpact:\u003c/h1\u003e\n\t\u003cp\u003eIn the worst case, an attacker could send a stream of\n\tcrafted fragments with a low packet rate which would consume\n\ta substantial amount of CPU.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003cp\u003eOther attack vectors allow an attacker to send a stream\n\tof crafted fragments which could consume a large amount of\n\tCPU or all available mbuf clusters on the system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003cp\u003eThese attacks could temporarily render a system unreachable\n\tthrough network interfaces or temporarily render a system\n\tunresponsive. The effects of the attack should clear within\n\t60 seconds after the attack stops.\u003c/p\u003e\n      ",
