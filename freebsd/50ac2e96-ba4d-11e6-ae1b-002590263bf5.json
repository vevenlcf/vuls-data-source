However, in both 32-bit and 64-bit,\n\t    a NULL LDT system segment is intended to prevent access.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eOn Intel hardware, loading a NULL selector zeros the base as well\n\t    as most attributes, but sets the limit field to its largest possible\n\t    value. On AMD hardware, loading a NULL selector zeros the attributes,\n\t    leaving the stale base and limit intact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eXen may erroneously permit the access using unexpected base/limit\n\t    values.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eAbility to exploit this vulnerability on Intel is easy, but on AMD\n\t    depends in a complicated way on how the guest kernel manages LDTs.\n\t    \u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eAn unprivileged guest user program may be able to elevate its\n\t      privilege to that of the guest operating system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
