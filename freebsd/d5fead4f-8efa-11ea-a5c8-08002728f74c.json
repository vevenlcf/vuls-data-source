This password check is performed through a\n\t    character-by-character string comparison, and so an attacker who is\n\t    able to measure the time taken by this check to a high degree of\n\t    accuracy could potentially use timing differences to gain knowledge of\n\t    the password. (This is understood to be feasible on a local network, but\n\t    not on the public internet.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
