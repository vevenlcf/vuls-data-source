This could allows attackers with control over\n       Thread Context Map (MDC) input data when the logging\n       configuration uses a non-default Pattern Layout with either a\n       Context Lookup (for example, $${ctx:loginId}) or a Thread\n       Context Map pattern (%X, %mdc, or %MDC) to craft malicious input\n       data using a JNDI Lookup pattern resulting in a denial of\n       service (DOS) attack. Log4j 2.15.0 makes a best-effort attempt\n       to restrict JNDI LDAP lookups to localhost by default. Log4j\n       2.16.0 fixes this issue by removing support for message lookup\n       patterns and disabling JNDI functionality by default.\n      \u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
