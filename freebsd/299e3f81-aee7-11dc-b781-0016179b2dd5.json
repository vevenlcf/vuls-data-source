Ts'o reports:\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003cblockquote cite=\"http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?group_id=2406\u0026amp;release_id=560230\"\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eFix a potential security vulnerability where an untrusted\n\t    filesystem can be corrupted in such a way that a program using\n\t    libext2fs will allocate a buffer which is far too small.  This\n\t    can lead to either a crash or potentially a heap-based buffer\n\t    overflow crash.  No known exploits exist, but main concern is\n\t    where an untrusted user who possesses privileged access in a\n\t    guest Xen environment could corrupt a filesystem which is then\n\t    accessed by thus allowing the untrusted user to gain privileged\n\t    access in the host OS.  Thanks to the McAfee AVERT Research group\n\t    for reporting this issue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
