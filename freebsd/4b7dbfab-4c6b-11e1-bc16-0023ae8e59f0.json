In certain configurations using RewriteRule with proxy\n\t    flag or ProxyPassMatch, a remote attacker could cause the reverse\n\t    proxy to connect to an arbitrary server, possibly disclosing\n\t    sensitive information from internal web servers not directly\n\t    accessible to attacker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eInteger overflow in the ap_pregsub function in server/util.c in\n\t    the Apache HTTP Server 2.0.x through 2.0.64 and 2.2.x through\n\t    2.2.21, when the mod_setenvif module is enabled, allows local\n\t    users to gain privileges via a .htaccess file with a crafted\n\t    SetEnvIf directive, in conjunction with a crafted HTTP request\n\t    header, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eAn additional exposure was found when using mod_proxy in\n\t    reverse proxy mode. In certain configurations using RewriteRule\n\t    with proxy flag or ProxyPassMatch, a remote attacker could cause\n\t    the reverse proxy to connect to an arbitrary server, possibly\n\t    disclosing sensitive information from internal web servers\n\t    not directly accessible to attacker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eA flaw was found in mod_log_config. If the '%{cookiename}C' log\n\t    format string is in use, a remote attacker could send a specific\n\t    cookie causing a crash.  This crash would only be a denial of\n\t    service if using a threaded MPM.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eA flaw was found in the handling of the scoreboard.  An\n\t    unprivileged child process could cause the parent process to\n\t    crash at shutdown rather than terminate cleanly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eA flaw was found in the default error response for status code\n\t    400.  This flaw could be used by an attacker to expose\n\t    \"httpOnly\" cookies when no custom ErrorDocument is specified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
