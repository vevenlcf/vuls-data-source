SECURITY FIX: When constructing paths of objects being archived, a buffer\n\t    could overflow by one byte upon encountering 1024, 2048, 4096, etc. byte\n\t    paths. Theoretically this could be exploited by an unprivileged user whose\n\t    files are being archived; I do not believe it is exploitable in practice,\n\t    but I am offering a $1000 bounty for the first person who can prove me wrong:\n\t    http://www.daemonology.net/blog/2015-08-21-tarsnap-1000-exploit-bounty.html\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003e2. SECURITY FIX: An attacker with a machine's write keys, or with read keys\n\t    and control of the tarsnap service, could make tarsnap allocate a large\n\t    amount of memory upon listing archives or reading an archive the attacker\n\t    created; on 32-bit machines, tarsnap can be caused to crash under the\n\t    aforementioned conditions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
