This might cause the process to run out of memory or invoke the OOM killer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eCrash in BER decoder - The BER decoder would crash due to reading from offset 0 of an empty vector if it encountered a BIT STRING which did not contain any data at all. This can be used to easily crash applications reading untrusted ASN.1 data, but does not seem exploitable for code execution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
