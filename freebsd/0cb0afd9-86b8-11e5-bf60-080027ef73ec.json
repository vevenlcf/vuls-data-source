For a PuTTY SSH session, this must be before\n\t    encryption, so the attacker likely needs access to the server you're\n\t    connecting to. For instance, an attacker on a multi-user machine\n\t    that you connect to could trick you into running cat on a file they\n\t    control containing a malicious escape sequence. (Unix write(1) is\n\t    not a vector for this, if implemented correctly.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eOnly PuTTY, PuTTYtel, and pterm are affected; other PuTTY tools do\n\t    not include the terminal emulator, so cannot be exploited this\n\t    way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
