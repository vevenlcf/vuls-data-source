In some cases, Opera may incorrectly allocate\n\t    too little space for a buffer, and may then store too much of the\n\t    response in that buffer.  This causes a buffer overflow, which in\n\t    turn can lead to a memory corruption and crash.  It is possible to\n\t    use this crash to execute the overflowing data as code, which may\n\t    be controlled by an attacking site.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
