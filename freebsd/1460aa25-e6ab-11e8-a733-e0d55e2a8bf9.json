This meant that the owners of the servers\n\t     referred in HTML files in your system could have seen in their access logs\n\t     your IP address every time the thumbnailer tried to create the thumbnail.\n\t  \u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003e\n\t    The HTML thumbnailer has been removed in upcoming KDE Applications 18.12.0\n\t    because it was actually not creating thumbnails for files at all.\n\t  \u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
