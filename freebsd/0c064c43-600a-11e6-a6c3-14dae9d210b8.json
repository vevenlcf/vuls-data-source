  "description": "\n\t\u003ch1\u003eProblem Description:\u003c/h1\u003e\n\t\u003cp\u003eTCP connections transitioning to the LAST_ACK state can\n\tbecome permanently stuck due to mishandling of protocol\n\tstate in certain situations, which in turn can lead to\n\taccumulated consumption and eventual exhaustion of system\n\tresources, such as mbufs and sockets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003ch1\u003eImpact:\u003c/h1\u003e\n\t\u003cp\u003eAn attacker who can repeatedly establish TCP connections\n\tto a victim system (for instance, a Web server) could create\n\tmany TCP connections that are stuck in LAST_ACK state and\n\tcause resource exhaustion, resulting in a denial of service\n\tcondition. This may also happen in normal operation where\n\tno intentional attack is conducted, but an attacker who can\n\tsend specifically crafted packets can trigger this more\n\treliably.\u003c/p\u003e\n      ",
