This could be abused to execute code the user didn't\n\t    expect. e.g., given a certain prompt configuration, an attacker\n\t    could trick a user into executing arbitrary code by having them\n\t    check out a Git branch with a specially crafted name.\n\t  \u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
