Any website can simply create a dns name that they\n\t    are authorized to communicate with, and then make it resolve to\n\t    localhost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eExploitation is simple, you could set script-torrent-done-enabled\n\t    and run any command, or set download-dir to /home/user/ and then\n\t    upload a torrent for .bashrc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
