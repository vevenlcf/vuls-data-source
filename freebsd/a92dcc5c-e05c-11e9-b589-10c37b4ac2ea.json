This can lead to filter\n\t    bypasses or request smuggling, the latter if requests from separate clients\n\t    are multiplexed onto the same connection by the proxy. Such invalid headers\n\t    are now rejected by Go servers, and passed without normalization to Go\n\t    client applications.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
