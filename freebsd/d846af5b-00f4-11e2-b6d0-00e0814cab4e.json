For this vulnerability to be exploited,\n\t      the attacker must have an HTTP access to a Jenkins master, and\n\t      he must have a read access to Jenkins.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t    \u003cli\u003eThe second vulnerability in Jenkins core is a cross-site\n\t      scripting vulnerability. This allows an attacker to craft an URL\n\t      that points to Jenkins, and if a legitimate user clicks this link,\n\t      and the attacker will be able to hijack the user session.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t    \u003cli\u003eThe third vulnerability is a cross-site scripting vulnerability\n\t      in the Violations plugin\u003c/li\u003e\n\t    \u003cli\u003eThe fourth vulnerability is a cross-site scripting vulnerability\n\t      in The Continuous Integration Game plugin\u003c/li\u003e\n\t  \u003c/ol\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
