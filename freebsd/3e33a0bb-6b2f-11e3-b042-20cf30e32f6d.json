The vulnerability is\n\t    known to be already exploited to gain unauthorised access to the\n\t    application using brute force mechanisms, however other kind of\n\t    attacks might be possible and/or already in use. The risk is rated\n\t    to be critical as the most common end goal of the attackers is to\n\t    spread malware to the visitors of all the websites and ad networks\n\t    that the ad server is being used on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eThe vulnerability is also present and exploitable in OpenX Source\n\t    2.8.11 and earlier versions, potentially back to phpAdsNew 2.0.x.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
