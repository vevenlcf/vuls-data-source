Several areas have been identified in the Documents and Emails module that could allow an authenticated user to perform SQL injection, as demonstrated by a backslash character at the end of a bean_id to modules/Emails/DetailView.php. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a crafted SQL request to the affected areas. An exploit could allow the attacker to modify the SQL database. Proper SQL escaping has been added to prevent such exploits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eAn issue was discovered in SugarCRM before 7.7.2.3, 7.8.x before 7.8.2.2, and 7.9.x before 7.9.2.0 (and Sugar Community Edition 6.5.26). A remote file inclusion has been identified in the Connectors module allowing authenticated users to include remotely accessible system files via a query string. Proper input validation has been added to mitigate this issue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eAn issue was discovered in SugarCRM before 7.7.2.3, 7.8.x before 7.8.2.2, and 7.9.x before 7.9.2.0 (and Sugar Community Edition 6.5.26). The WebToLeadCapture functionality is found vulnerable to unauthenticated cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. This attack vector is mitigated by proper validating the redirect URL values being passed along.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
