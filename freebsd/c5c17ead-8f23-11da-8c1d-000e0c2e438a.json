This creates a window during\n\t  which an attacker could replace the file with a link to\n\t  another file.

This may cause damage in\n\t  itself (e.g., by destroying important system files or\n\t  documents) or may be used to obtain elevated privileges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003cp\u003eWorkaround\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003cp\u003eDo not use the cvsbug(1) utility on any system with untrusted\n\t  users.\u003cbr/\u003e\n\t  Do not use the send-pr(1) utility on a FreeBSD 4.10 or 5.3\n\t  system with untrusted users.\u003c/p\u003e\n      ",
