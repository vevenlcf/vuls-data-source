During subpattern calculation of a malformed regular\n\t    expression, an offset that is used as an array index is fully\n\t    controlled and can be large enough so that unexpected heap\n\t    memory regions are accessed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eOne could at least exploit this issue to read objects nearby of\n\t    the affected application's memory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eSuch information disclosure may also be used to bypass memory\n\t    protection method such as ASLR.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
