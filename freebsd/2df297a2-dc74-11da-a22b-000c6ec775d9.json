Input starting with a pipe character (\"|\")\n\t    leads to an insecure call to Perl's open function and the\n\t    rest of the input being executed in a shell. The code is\n\t    run in the context of the process running the AWStats\n\t    CGI.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eArbitrary code can be executed by uploading a specially\n\t    crafted configuration file if an attacker can put a file\n\t    on the server with chosen file name and content (e.g. by\n\t    using an FTP account on a shared hosting server). In this\n\t    configuration file, the LogFile directive can be used to\n\t    execute shell code following a pipe character. As above,\n\t    an open call on unsanitized input is the source of this\n\t    vulnerability.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
