  "description": "\n    \u003ch1\u003eProblem Description:\u003c/h1\u003e\n      \u003cp\u003eAffected Synapse versions assume that all events have an \"origin\" field set. If an event\n      without the \"origin\" field is sent into a federated room, servers not already joined to\n      the room will be unable to do so due to failing to fetch the malformed event.\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ch1\u003eImpact:\u003c/h1\u003e\n      \u003cp\u003eAn attacker could cause a denial of service by deliberately sending a malformed event\n      into a room, thus preventing new servers (and thus their users) from joining the\n      room.\u003c/p\u003e\n      ",
