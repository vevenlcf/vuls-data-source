The Overlay module does\n\t    not sufficiently validate URLs prior to displaying their contents,\n\t    leading to an open redirect vulnerability.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that it can only be\n\t    used against site users who have the \"Access the administrative\n\t    overlay\" permission, and that the Overlay module must be enabled.\n\t    \u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eAn incomplete fix for this issue was released as part of\n\t    SA-CORE-2015-002.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
