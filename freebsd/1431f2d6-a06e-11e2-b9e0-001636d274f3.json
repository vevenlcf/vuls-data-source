This\n\t     can cause a denial of service (e.g., an X server segmentation\n\t     fault), or could be exploited to achieve arbitrary code\n\t     execution.  Because the X server runs as setuid root in many\n\t     configurations, an attacker could potentially use this\n\t     vulnerability in those configurations to gain root privileges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
