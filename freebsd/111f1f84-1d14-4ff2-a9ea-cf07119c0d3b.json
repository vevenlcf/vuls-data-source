A remote attacker could provide a\n\t    specially-crafted YAML document that, when parsed by an application\n\t    using libyaml, would cause the application to crash or, potentially,\n\t    execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the\n\t    application.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
