When writing to a TLS enabled socket, node::StreamBase::Write calls node::TLSWrap::DoWrite with a freshly allocated WriteWrap object as first argument. If the DoWrite method does not return an error, this object is passed back to the caller as part of a StreamWriteResult structure. This may be exploited to corrupt memory leading to a Denial of Service or potentially other exploits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003ch1\u003eHTTP Request Smuggling in nodejs (Low) (CVE-2020-8287)\u003c/h1\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eAffected versions of Node.js allow two copies of a header field in a http request. For example, two Transfer-Encoding header fields. In this case Node.js identifies the first header field and ignores the second. This can lead to HTTP Request Smuggling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003ch1\u003eOpenSSL - EDIPARTYNAME NULL pointer de-reference (CVE-2020-1971)\u003c/h1\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eiThis is a vulnerability in OpenSSL which may be exploited through Node.js.
