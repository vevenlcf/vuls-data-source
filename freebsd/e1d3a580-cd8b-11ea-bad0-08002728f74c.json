Allowing HTML within help\n\t    text is an intentional design decision by Django; however, as a matter\n\t    of policy Wagtail does not allow editors to insert arbitrary HTML by\n\t    default, as this could potentially be used to carry out cross-site\n\t    scripting attacks, including privilege escalation. This functionality\n\t    should therefore not have been made available to editor-level users.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eThe vulnerability is not exploitable by an ordinary site visitor\n\t    without access to the Wagtail admin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
