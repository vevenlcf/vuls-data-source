If an HTTP server has been\n\t    enabled, it will always serve both HTML pages and an XML-RPC interface. A vulnerability has been\n\t    found where an authenticated client can send a malicious XML-RPC request to supervisord that\n\t    will run arbitrary shell commands on the server. The commands will be run as the same user as\n\t    supervisord. Depending on how supervisord has been configured, this may be root.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eThis vulnerability can only be exploited by an authenticated client or if supervisord has been\n\t    configured to run an HTTP server without authentication. If authentication has not been enabled,\n\t    supervisord will log a message at the critical level every time it starts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
