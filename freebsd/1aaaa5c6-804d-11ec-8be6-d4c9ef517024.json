Many EC algorithms are affected, including some of the\n\t    TLS 1.3 default curves. Impact was not analyzed in detail, because the\n\t    pre-requisites for attack are considered unlikely and include reusing\n\t    private keys. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA as a\n\t    result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not\n\t    believed likely. Attacks against DH are considered just feasible\n\t    (although very difficult) because most of the work necessary to deduce\n\t    information about a private key may be performed offline. The amount\n\t    of resources required for such an attack would be significant.\n\t    However, for an attack on TLS to be meaningful, the server would have\n\t    to share the DH private key among multiple clients, which is no longer\n\t    an option since CVE-2016-0701.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
