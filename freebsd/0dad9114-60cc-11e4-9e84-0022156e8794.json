This\n\t  means a slave can ask a master to do just about anything\n\t  within the confinement of the operating system, such as\n\t  accessing files on the master or trigger other jobs on\n\t  Jenkins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eThis has increasingly become problematic, as larger\n\t  enterprise deployments have developed more sophisticated\n\t  trust separation model, where the administators of a master\n\t  might take slaves owned by other teams.  In such an\n\t  environment, slaves are less trusted than the master.\n\t  Yet the \"single distributed process\" assumption was not\n\t  communicated well to the users, resulting in vulnerabilities\n\t  in some deployments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eSECURITY-144 (CVE-2014-3665) introduces a new subsystem\n\t  to address this problem.  This feature is off by default for\n\t  compatibility reasons.  See Wiki for more details, who should\n\t  turn this on, and implications.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eCVE-2014-3566 is rated high.  It only affects\n\t  installations that accept slaves from less trusted\n\t  computers, but this will allow an owner of of such slave to\n\t  mount a remote code execution attack on Jenkins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
