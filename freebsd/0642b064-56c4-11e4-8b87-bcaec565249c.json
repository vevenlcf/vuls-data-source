A remote attacker could provide a specially crafted\n\t    XML file that, when processed by an application using\n\t    libxml2, would lead to excessive CPU consumption (denial of\n\t    service) based on excessive entity substitutions, even if\n\t    entity substitution was disabled, which is the parser default\n\t    behavior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
