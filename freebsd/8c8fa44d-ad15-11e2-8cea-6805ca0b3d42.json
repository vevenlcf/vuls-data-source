This is done by passing a crafted argument as the\n\t  regular expression, containing a null byte. phpMyAdmin does\n\t  not correctly sanitize an argument passed to preg_replace()\n\t  when using the \"Replace table prefix\" feature, opening the\n\t  way to this vulnerability..\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eThis vulnerability can be triggered only by someone who\n\t  logged in to phpMyAdmin, as the usual token protection\n\t  prevents non-logged-in users to access the required\n\t  form.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\t\u003cblockquote cite=\"http://www.phpmyadmin.net/home_page/security/PMASA-2013-3.php\"\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003ephpMyAdmin can be configured to save an export file on\n\t  the web server, via its SaveDir directive. With this in\n\t  place, it's possible, either via a crafted filename template\n\t  or a crafted table name, to save a double extension file\n\t  like foobar.php.sql. In turn, an Apache webserver on which\n\t  there is no definition for the MIME type \"sql\" (the default)\n\t  will treat this saved file as a \".php\" script, leading to\n\t  remote code execution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eThis vulnerability can be triggered only by someone who\n\t  logged in to phpMyAdmin, as the usual token protection\n\t  prevents non-logged-in users to access the required\n\t  form. Moreover, the SaveDir directive is empty by default,\n\t  so a default configuration is not vulnerable. The\n\t  $cfg['SaveDir'] directive must be configured, and the server\n\t  must be running Apache with mod_mime to be exploitable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
