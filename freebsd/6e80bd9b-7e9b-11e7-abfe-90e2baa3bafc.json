Such a URL could be generated by a malicious\n\t  server, by a malicious user committing to a honest server (to attack another\n\t  user of that server's repositories), or by a proxy server.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eThe vulnerability affects all clients, including those that use file://,\n\t  http://, and plain (untunneled) svn://.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eAn exploit has been tested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
