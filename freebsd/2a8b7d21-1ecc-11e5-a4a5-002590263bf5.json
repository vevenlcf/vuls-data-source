This vulnerability affects all existing\n\t    releases up to and including versions 1.12.2 and 1.13.0.\n\t    Additionally, version 1.12.3 included only a partial fix that failed\n\t    to guard users against attempts to read from .pbl files with an\n\t    uppercase or mixed-case extension. CVE-2015-5069 and CVE-2015-5070\n\t    have been assigned to the vulnerability affecting .pbl files with a\n\t    lowercase extension, and .pbl files with an uppercase or mixed-case\n\t    extension, respectively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
