This output filtering secures\n\t    the site against cross site scripting attacks via user input.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eCertain byte sequences that are invalid in the UTF8\n\t    specification are not handled properly by Internet Explorer 6\n\t    and may lead it to see a multibyte start character where none is\n\t    present. Internet Explorer 6 then consumes a number of\n\t    subsequent UTF-8 characters. This may lead to unsafe attributes\n\t    that were outside a tag for the filter to appear inside a tag\n\t    for Internet Explorer 6. This behaviour can then be used to\n\t    insert and execute javascript in the context of the website.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
