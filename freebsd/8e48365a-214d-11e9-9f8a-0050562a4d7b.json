Older releases are not affected.\n\n\t     NOTE: The attacker needs to know in advance valid addresses in the peer's\n\t     memory to jump to, so measures like ASLR are effective mitigations.\n\n\t     NOTE: this attack can only take place after authentication, so peers behind\n\t     CURVE/GSSAPI are not vulnerable to unauthenticated attackers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
