A malicious client with string\n\t    lengths exceeding the request length can cause the server to copy\n\t    adjacent memory data into the XKB structs. This data is then\n\t    available to the client via the XkbGetGeometry request. The\n\t    data length is at least up to 64k, it is possible to obtain\n\t    more data by chaining strings, each string length is then\n\t    determined by whatever happens to be in that 16-bit region of\n\t    memory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eA similarly crafted request can likely cause the X server\n\t    to crash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
