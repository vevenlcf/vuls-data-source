If a payload length\n\t  of zero was received the code would incorrectly attempt\n\t  to resize to zero. This operation would succeed and end\n\t  up freeing the memory but be treated as a failure. When\n\t  the session was subsequently torn down this memory would\n\t  get freed yet again causing a crash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eUsers of the WebSocket functionality also did not take\n\t  into account that provided text frames are not guaranteed\n\t  to be NULL terminated. This has been fixed in chan_sip\n\t  and chan_pjsip in the applicable versions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
