An attacker\n\t    could take advantage of this by sending repeated requests\n\t    with extremely large strings in the Accept-Language header,\n\t    potentially causing a denial of service by filling available\n\t    memory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eDue to limitations imposed by Web server software on the\n\t    size of HTTP header fields, combined with reasonable limits\n\t    on the number of requests which may be handled by a single\n\t    server process over its lifetime, this vulnerability may be\n\t    difficult to exploit. Additionally, it is only present when\n\t    the \"USE_I18N\" setting in Django is \"True\" and the i18n\n\t    middleware component is enabled*. Nonetheless, all users of\n\t    affected versions of Django are encouraged to update.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
