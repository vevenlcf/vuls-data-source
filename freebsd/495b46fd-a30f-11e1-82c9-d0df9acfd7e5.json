However, the assumption that only\n\t     authenticated users with CHANGE permission may create script content\n\t     is false if new users exploit the vulnerability detailed in this\n\t     alert to manipulate the registration agent into creating that\n\t     content for them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
