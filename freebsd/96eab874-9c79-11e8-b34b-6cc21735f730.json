In particular, the state variable that determined whether\n\t  or not a password is needed for a connection would not be reset, which\n\t  could allow users of features requiring libpq, such as the \"dblink\" or\n\t  \"postgres_fdw\" extensions, to login to servers they should not be able\n\t  to access.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eCVE-2018-10925: Memory disclosure and missing authorization in\n\t  `INSERT ...
