Prior to this release, a user\n\t    able to execute SQL queries with permissions to read a\n\t    given column could craft a leaky operator that could\n\t    read whatever data had been sampled from that column.\n\t    If this happened to include values from rows that the user\n\t    is forbidden to see by a row security policy, the user\n\t    could effectively bypass the policy. This is fixed by only\n\t    allowing a non-leakproof operator to use this data if\n\t    there are no relevant row security policies for the table.\n\t  \u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
