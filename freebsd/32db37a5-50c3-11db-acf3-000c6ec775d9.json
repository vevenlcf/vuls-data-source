[CVE-2006-5051]\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003ch1\u003eImpact\u003c/h1\u003e\n\t\u003cp\u003eAn attacker sending specially crafted packets to sshd(8)\n\t  can cause a Denial of Service by using 100% of CPU time\n\t  until a connection timeout occurs.  Since this attack can be\n\t  performed over multiple connections simultaneously, it is\n\t  possible to cause up to MaxStartups (10 by default) sshd\n\t  processes to use all the CPU time they can obtain.\n\t  [CVE-2006-4924]\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003cp\u003eThe OpenSSH project believe that the race condition can\n\t  lead to a Denial of Service or potentially remote code\n\t  execution, but the FreeBSD Security Team has been unable to\n\t  verify the exact impact.
