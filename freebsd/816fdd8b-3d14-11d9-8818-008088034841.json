  "description": "\n\t\u003cp\u003eWhen the option imapmagicplus is activated on a server the\n\t  PROXY and LOGIN commands suffer a standard stack overflow,\n\t  because the username is not checked against a maximum length\n\t  when it is copied into a temporary stack buffer. This bug is\n\t  especially dangerous because it can be triggered before any\n\t  kind of authentification took place.\u003c/p\u003e\n      ",
