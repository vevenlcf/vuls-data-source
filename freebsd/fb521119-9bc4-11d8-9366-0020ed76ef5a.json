Everyone running any\n\t    previous version should upgrade to 1.6 immediately - the\n\t    vulnerability may allow a remote exploit. No exploits are\n\t    currently known and none have been observed in the wild\n\t    till now. The danger is minimised if you run Pound in a\n\t    root jail and/or you run Pound as non-root user.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
