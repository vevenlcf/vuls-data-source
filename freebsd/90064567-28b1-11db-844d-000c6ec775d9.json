This means that\n\t    you can essentially take down a Rails process by starting\n\t    something like /script/profiler, as the code will run for a\n\t    long time and that process will be hung while it happens.\n\t    Other URLs can even cause data loss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
