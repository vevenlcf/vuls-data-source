  "description": "\n\t\u003cp\u003erssh expands command line paramters before invoking chroot.\n\t  This could result in the disclosure to the client of file\n\t  names outside of the chroot directory.  A posting by the rssh\n\t  author explains:\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003cblockquote cite=\"http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=bugtraq\u0026amp;m=108787373022844\"\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eThe cause of the problem identified by Mr. McCaw is that\n\t    rssh expanded command-line arguments prior to entering\n\t    the chroot jail.  This bug DOES NOT allow a user to\n\t    access any of the files outside the jail, but can allow\n\t    them to discover what files are in a directory which is\n\t    outside the jail, if their credentials on the server would\n\t    normally allow them read/execute access in the specified\n\t    directory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
