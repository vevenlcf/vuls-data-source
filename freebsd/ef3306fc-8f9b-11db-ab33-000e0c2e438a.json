Also for a\n\t  recursive DNS server, an assertion failure can occur when\n\t  processing a query whose reply will contain more than one\n\t  SIG(covered) RRset.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003cp\u003eFor an authoritative DNS server serving a RFC 2535 DNSSEC\n\t  zone which is queried for the SIG records where there are\n\t  multiple SIG(covered) RRsets (e.g. a zone apex), named(8)\n\t  will trigger an assertion failure when it tries to construct\n\t  the response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003ch1\u003eImpact\u003c/h1\u003e\n\t\u003cp\u003eAn attacker who can perform recursive lookups on a DNS server\n\t  and is able to send a sufficiently large number of recursive\n\t  queries, or is able to get the DNS server to return more than\n\t  one SIG(covered) RRsets can stop the functionality of the DNS\n\t  service.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003cp\u003eAn attacker querying an authoritative DNS server serving a\n\t  RFC 2535 DNSSEC zone may be able to crash the DNS server.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003ch1\u003eWorkaround\u003c/h1\u003e\n\t\u003cp\u003eA possible workaround is to only allow trusted clients to\n\t  perform recursive queries.\u003c/p\u003e\n      ",
