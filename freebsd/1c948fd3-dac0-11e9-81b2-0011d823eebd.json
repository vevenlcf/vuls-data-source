The deterministic ECDSA function\n\t    reused this by passing the RNG object created from the private key\n\t    and the message to be signed as prescribed by RFC 6979. This meant\n\t    that the same RNG object was used whenever the same message was\n\t    signed, rendering the blinding ineffective.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eIf the victim can be tricked to sign the same message repeatedly,\n\t    the private key may be recoverable through side channels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
