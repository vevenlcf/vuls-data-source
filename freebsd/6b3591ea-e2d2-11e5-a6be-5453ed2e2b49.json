The resulting secret is 128 bits long, instead of the\n\t  recommended sizes of 1024 and 2048 bits respectively. There are\n\t  practical algorithms (Baby steps/Giant steps, Pollardâ€™s rho) that can\n\t  solve this problem in O(2^63) operations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eBoth client and server are are vulnerable, pre-authentication.\n\t  This vulnerability could be exploited by an eavesdropper with enough\n\t  resources to decrypt or intercept SSH sessions.
