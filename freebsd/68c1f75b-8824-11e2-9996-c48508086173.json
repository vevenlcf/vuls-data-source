This flaw could be exploited to carry out a\n\t    denial of service attack against code that uses arbitrary\n\t    user input as hash keys.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eBecause using user-provided strings as hash keys is a\n\t    very common operation, we urge users of perl to update their\n\t    perl executable as soon as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
