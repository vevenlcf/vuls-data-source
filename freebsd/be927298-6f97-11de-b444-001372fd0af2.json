By enticing a suitably privileged user\n\t    to visit a specially crafted URL, a malicious user is able to\n\t    insert arbitrary HTML and script code into forum pages.  Such a\n\t    cross-site scripting attack may lead to the malicious user\n\t    gaining administrative access.  Wikipedia has more information\n\t    about cross-site scripting (XSS).\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eUser signatures have no separate input format, they use the\n\t    format of the comment with which they are displayed.  A user\n\t    will no longer be able to edit a comment when an administrator\n\t    changes the comment's input format to a format that is not\n\t    accessible to the user.  However they will still be able to\n\t    modify their signature, which will then be processed by the new\n\t    input format.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eIf the new format is very permissive, via their signature, the\n\t    user may be able to insert arbitrary HTML and script code into\n\t    pages or, when the PHP filter is enabled for the new format,\n\t    execute PHP code.  This issue affects Drupal 6.x only.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eWhen an anonymous user fails to login due to mistyping his\n\t    username or password, and the page he is on contains a sortable\n\t    table, the (incorrect) username and password are included in\n\t    links on the table.  If the user visits these links the password\n\t    may then be leaked to external sites via the HTTP referer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eIn addition, if the anonymous user is enticed to visit the site\n\t    via a specially crafted URL while the Drupal page cache is\n\t    enabled, a malicious user might be able to retrieve the\n\t    (incorrect) username and password from the page cache.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n     ",
