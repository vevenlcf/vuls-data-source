A malicious process could\n\t    force system services or user applications to be disconnected\n\t    from the D-Bus system bus by sending them a message containing\n\t    a file descriptor, then causing that file descriptor to exceed\n\t    the kernel's maximum recursion depth (itself introduced to fix\n\t    a DoS) before dbus-daemon forwards the message to the victim\n\t    process. Most services and applications exit when disconnected\n\t    from the system bus, leading to a denial of service.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eAdditionally, Alban discovered that bug fd.o#79694, a bug\n\t    previously reported by Alejandro Martínez Suárez which was n\n\t    believed to be security flaw, could be used for a similar denial\n\t    of service, by causing dbus-daemon to attempt to forward invalid\n\t    file descriptors to a victim process when file descriptors become\n\t    associated with the wrong message.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
