This can be exploited to execute arbitrary PHP code by\n\t    uploading a malicious PHP script with multiple extensions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability requires that Apache\n\t    is not configured to handle the mime-type for media files with an e.g.\n\t    \"gif\", \"jpg\", \"png\", \"tif\", \"wmv\" extension.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eInput passed via certain parameters to press-this.php is not\n\t    properly sanitised before being displayed to the user. This can be\n\t    exploited to insert arbitrary HTML and script code, which will be\n\t    executed in a user's browser session in context of an affected site\n\t    when the malicious data is being viewed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
