If the pid file is in a directory\n\t    writeable by unprivileged users, the destination could be replaced by a\n\t    symlink allowing for privilege escalation.  svnserve does not create a pid\n\t    file by default.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eAll versions are only vulnerable when the --pid-file=ARG option is used.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
