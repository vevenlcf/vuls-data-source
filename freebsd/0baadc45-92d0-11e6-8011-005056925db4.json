That security vulnerability affects the admin console\n\t    that is part of the Axis2 Web application and was originally reported\n\t    for SAP BusinessObjects (which includes a version of Axis2). That report\n\t    didnâ€™t mention Axis2 at all and the Axis2 project only recently became\n\t    aware (thanks to Devesh Bhatt and Nishant Agarwala) that the issue\n\t    affects Apache Axis2 as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
