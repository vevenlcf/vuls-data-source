This may also be used to populate a file\n\t    upload form, resulting in uploading of arbitrary files to\n\t    a malicious web site.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eSuccessful exploitation requires that the user is tricked\n\t    into dragging and dropping e.g. an image or a link.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
