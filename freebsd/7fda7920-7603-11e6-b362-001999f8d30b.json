Most SIP request types result in an \"artificial\"\n\t  endpoint being looked up, but ACKs bypass this lookup.\n\t  The resulting NULL pointer results in a crash when\n\t  attempting to determine if ACLs should be applied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eThis issue was introduced in the Asterisk 13.10 release\n\t  and only affects that release.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eThis issue only affects users using the PJSIP stack\n\t  with Asterisk.
