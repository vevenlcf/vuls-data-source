This method produces predictable file names based\n\t  on the process ID and fails to confirm which path will be over\n\t  written with the user.\u003cbr/\u003e\n\t  It should be noted that ispell does not have to be installed\n\t  in order for this to be exploited.  The option simply needs to\n\t  be selected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003cp\u003eImpact\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003cp\u003eThese predictable temporary file names are problematic\n\t  because they allow an attacker to take advantage of a race\n\t  condition in order to execute a symlink attack, which could\n\t  allow them to overwrite files on the system in the context of\n\t  the user running the ee(1) editor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003cp\u003eWorkaround\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003cp\u003eInstead of invoking ispell through ee(1), invoke it directly.\u003c/p\u003e\n      ",
