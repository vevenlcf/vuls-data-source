  "description": "\n\t\u003cp\u003eUS CERT reports:\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003cblockquote cite=\"http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/625617\"\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eJava 7 Update 10 and earlier versions of Java 7 contain a\n\t    vulnerability that can allow a remote, unauthenticated\n\t    attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable\n\t    system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eThe Java JRE plug-in provides its own Security Manager.\n\t    Typically, a web applet runs with a security manager\n\t    provided by the browser or Java Web Start plugin. Oracle's\n\t    document states, \"If there is a security manager already\n\t    installed, this method first calls the security manager's\n\t    checkPermission method with a\n\t    RuntimePermission(\"setSecurityManager\") permission to ensure\n\t    it's safe to replace the existing security manager.  This may\n\t    result in throwing a SecurityException\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eBy leveraging the vulnerability in the Java Management\n\t    Extensions (JMX) MBean components, unprivileged Java code\n\t    can access restricted classes.  By using that vulnerability\n\t    in conjunction with a second vulnerability involving the\n\t    Reflection API and the invokeWithArguments method of the\n\t    MethodHandle class, an untrusted Java applet can escalate\n\t    its privileges by calling the the setSecurityManager()\n\t    function to allow full privileges, without requiring code\n\t    signing.  Oracle Java 7 update 10 and earlier Java 7 versions\n\t    are affected. The invokeWithArguments method was introduced\n\t    with Java 7, so therefore Java 6 is not affected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eThis vulnerability is being attacked in the wild, and is\n\t    reported to be incorporated into exploit kits. Exploit code\n\t    for this vulnerability is also publicly available.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\t\u003cp\u003eEsteban Guillardoy from Immunity Inc. additionally clarifies\n\t  on the recursive reflection exploitation technique:\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003cblockquote cite=\"https://partners.immunityinc.com/idocs/Java%20MBeanInstantiator.findClass%200day%20Analysis.pdf\"\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eThe real issue is in the native\n\t    sun.reflect.Reflection.getCallerClass method.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eWe can see the following information in the Reflection\n\t    source code:\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eReturns the class of the method realFramesToSkip frames\n\t    up the stack (zero-based), ignoring frames associated with\n\t    java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke() and its\n\t    implementation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eSo what is happening here is that they forgot to skip the\n\t  frames related to the new Reflection API and only the old\n\t  reflection API is taken into account.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\t\u003cp\u003eThis exploit does not only affect Java applets, but every\n\t  piece of software that relies on the Java Security Manager for\n\t  sandboxing executable code is affected: malicious code can\n\t  totally disable Security Manager.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003cp\u003eFor users who are running native Web browsers with enabled\n\t  Java plugin, the workaround is to remove the java/icedtea-web\n\t  port and restart all browser instances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003cp\u003eFor users who are running Linux Web browser flavors, the\n\t  workaround is either to disable the Java plugin in browser\n\t  or to upgrade linux-sun-* packages to the non-vulnerable\n\t  version.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003cp\u003eIt is not recommended to run untrusted applets using\n\t  appletviewer, since this may lead to the execution of the\n\t  malicious code on vulnerable versions on JDK/JRE.\u003c/p\u003e\n      ",
