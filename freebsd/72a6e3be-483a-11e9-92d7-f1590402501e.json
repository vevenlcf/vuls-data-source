The fix involves setting the X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff\n\t    header, and applying CSRF checks previously on all non-GET API requests\n\t    to GET requests to API endpoints and the /files/ endpoint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eThe attacking page is able to access some contents of files when using\n\t    Internet Explorer through script errors, but this has not been\n\t    demonstrated with other browsers. A CVE has been requested for this\n\t    vulnerability.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
