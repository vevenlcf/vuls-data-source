When h2o is\n       used as a reverse proxy, an attacker can abuse this vulnerability\n       to send internal state of h2o to backend servers controlled by\n       the attacker or third party. Also, if there is an HTTP endpoint\n       that reflects the traffic sent from the client, an attacker can\n       use that reflector to obtain internal state of h2o.\u003c/p\u003e\n       \u003cp\u003eThis internal state includes traffic of other connections in\n       unencrypted form and TLS session tickets.\u003c/p\u003e\n       \u003cp\u003eThis vulnerability exists in h2o server with HTTP/3\n       support, between commit 93af138 and d1f0f65. None of the\n       released versions of h2o are affected by this vulnerability.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
