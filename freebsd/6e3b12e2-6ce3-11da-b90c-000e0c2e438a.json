This flaw exists because input passed to\n\t    \"target_field\" parameter in \"view_filters_page.php\" isn't\n\t    properly sanitised before being returned to the user.  This\n\t    could allow a user to create a specially crafted URL that\n\t    would execute arbitrary code in a user's browser within the\n\t    trust relationship between the browser and the server,\n\t    leading to a loss of integrity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
