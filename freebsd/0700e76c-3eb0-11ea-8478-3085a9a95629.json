If an image reports that it\n\t    has a large number of bands, a large amount of resources will be\n\t    used when trying to process the image. This is fixed by limiting the\n\t    number of bands to those usable by Pillow.\n\t  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\n\t    Buffer overruns were found when processing an SGI, PCX or FLI image.\n\t    Checks have been added to prevent this.\n\t  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\n\t    Overflow checks have been added when calculating the size of a\n\t    memory block to be reallocated in the processing of a TIFF image.\n\t  \u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
