For which they then show that it can be used to\n\t    mount an attack on the RSA key. Although their test attack is\n\t    done on a local system, there seems to be enough indication\n\t    that this can properly be performed from a remote system as\n\t    well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eAll versions prior to PolarSSL 1.2.9 and 1.3.0 are affected\n\t    if a third party can send arbitrary handshake messages to your\n\t    server.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eIf correctly executed, this attack reveals the entire private\n\t    RSA key after a large number of attack messages (\u0026gt; 600.000 on\n\t    a local machine) are sent to show the timing differences.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
