The people affected were\n\t    primarily located in Iran.  The attacker used a fraudulent SSL\n\t    certificate issued by DigiNotar, a root certificate authority that\n\t    should not issue certificates for Google (and has since revoked\n\t    it).

[...] an external\n\t    security audit concluded that all fraudulently issued certificates\n\t    were\n\t    revoked.  Recently, it was discovered that at least one fraudulent\n\t    certificate had not been revoked at the time.
