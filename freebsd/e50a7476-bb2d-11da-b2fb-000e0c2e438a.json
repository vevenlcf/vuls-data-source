  "description": "\n\t\u003ch1\u003eProblem Description\u003c/h1\u003e\n\t\u003cp\u003eIPsec provides an anti-replay service which when enabled\n\t  prevents an attacker from successfully executing a replay\n\t  attack.  This is done through the verification of sequence\n\t  numbers.  A programming error in the fast_ipsec(4)\n\t  implementation results in the sequence number associated with\n\t  a Security Association not being updated, allowing packets to\n\t  unconditionally pass sequence number verification checks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003ch1\u003eImpact\u003c/h1\u003e\n\t\u003cp\u003eAn attacker able to intercept IPSec packets can replay\n\t  them.  If higher level protocols which do not provide any\n\t  protection against packet replays (e.g., UDP) are used, this\n\t  may have a variety of effects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003ch1\u003eWorkaround\u003c/h1\u003e\n\t\u003cp\u003eNo workaround is available.\u003c/p\u003e\n      ",
