Information could be retrieved by the attacker by, e.g., using hidden sections to store the information, tricking the user into saving the document and convincing the user to sent the document back to the attacker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eThe vulnerability is mitigated by the need for the attacker to know the precise file path in the target system, and the need to trick the user into saving the document and sending it back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\t\u003cblockquote cite=\"https://www.openoffice.org/security/cves/CVE-2017-9806.html\"\u003e\n\t  \u003ch1\u003eCVE-2017-9806: Out-of-Bounds Write in Writer's WW8Fonts Constructor\u003c/h1\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eA vulnerability in the OpenOffice Writer DOC file parser, and specifically in the WW8Fonts Constructor, allows attackers to craft malicious documents that cause denial of service (memory corruption and application crash) potentially resulting in arbitrary code execution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\t\u003cblockquote cite=\"https://www.openoffice.org/security/cves/CVE-2017-12607.html\"\u003e\n\t  \u003ch1\u003eCVE-2017-12607: Out-of-Bounds Write in Impress' PPT Filter\u003c/h1\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eA vulnerability in OpenOffice's PPT file parser, and specifically in PPTStyleSheet, allows attackers to craft malicious documents that cause denial of service (memory corruption and application crash) potentially resulting in arbitrary code execution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\t\u003cblockquote cite=\"https://www.openoffice.org/security/cves/CVE-2017-12608.html\"\u003e\n\t  \u003ch1\u003eCVE-2017-12608: Out-of-Bounds Write in Writer's ImportOldFormatStyles\u003c/h1\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eA vulnerability in OpenOffice Writer DOC file parser, and specifically in ImportOldFormatStyles, allows attackers to craft malicious documents that cause denial of service (memory corruption and application crash) potentially resulting in arbitrary code execution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
