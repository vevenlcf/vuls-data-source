In particular,\n\ttmpfs(5), smbfs(5), autofs(5) and mqueuefs(5) were failing to do so.\n\tAs a result, eight uninitialized kernel stack bytes may be leaked to\n\tuserspace by these file systems. This problem is not present in\n\tFreeBSD 11.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003cp\u003eAdditionally, msdosfs(5) was failing to zero-fill a pair of padding\n\tfields in the dirent structure, resulting in a leak of three\n\tuninitialized bytes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003ch1\u003eImpact:\u003c/h1\u003e\n\t\u003cp\u003eKernel stack disclosures may leak sensitive information which could\n\tbe used to compromise the security of the system.\u003c/p\u003e\n      ",
