Remote Heap Overflow: If an attacker sends a\n\t    packet larger than 1024 bytes that gets stored temporarily (which\n\t    occurs many times - such as when sending a ZRTP Hello packet), a\n\t    heap overflow will occur, leading to potential arbitrary code\n\t    execution on the vulnerable host.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eVulnerability 2. Multiple Stack Overflows: ZRTPCPP contains\n\t    multiple stack overflows that arise when preparing a response\n\t    to a client's ZRTP Hello packet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eVulnerability 3. Information Leaking / Out of Bounds Reads:\n\t    The ZRTPCPP library performs very little validation regarding the\n\t    expected size of a packet versus the actual amount of data\n\t    received. This can lead to both information leaking and out\n\t    of bounds data reads (usually resulting in a crash).\n\t    Information leaking can be performed for example by sending\n\t    a malformed ZRTP Ping packet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
