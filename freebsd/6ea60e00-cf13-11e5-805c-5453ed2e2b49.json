X is used in several internal temporary variable roles,\n\t    but can take a value up to the width of the image. Im-\u0026gt;image[y]\n\t    is a set of row pointers to segments of memory that are the size of\n\t    the row. At the max y, this will write the contents of the line off\n\t    the end of the memory buffer, causing a segfault.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eThis issue was found by Alyssa Besseling at Atlassian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
