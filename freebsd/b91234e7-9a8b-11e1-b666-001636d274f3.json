The vulnerability\n\t    makes it possible for an attacker who has read and write access\n\t    to the GPU device nodes to reconfigure GPUs to gain access to\n\t    arbitrary system memory.  NVIDIA is not aware of any reports of\n\t    this vulnerability, outside of the disclosure which was made\n\t    privately to NVIDIA.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eNVIDIA has identified the root cause of the vulnerability and\n\t    has released updated drivers which close it.  [NVIDIA encourages]\n\t    all users with Geforce 8 or newer, G80 Quadro or newer, and all\n\t    Tesla GPUs to update their drivers to 295.40 or later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\t\u003cp\u003eLater, it was additionally discovered that similar exploit could\n\t  be achieved through remapping of VGA window:\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003cblockquote cite=\"http://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3140\"\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eNVIDIA received notification of a security exploit that uses\n\t    NVIDIA UNIX device files to map and program registers to redirect\n\t    the VGA window.  Through the VGA window, the exploit can access\n\t    any region of physical system memory.  This arbitrary memory\n\t    access can be further exploited, for example, to escalate user\n\t    privileges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
