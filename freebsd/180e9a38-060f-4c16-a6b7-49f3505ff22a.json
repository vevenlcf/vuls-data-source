For example, on a multi-user\n\t  system, it may be possible to steal cryptographic keys used in\n\t  applications such as OpenSSH or SSL-enabled web servers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNOTE:\u003c/strong\u003e Similar problems may exist in other\n\t  simultaneous multithreading implementations, or even some\n\t  systems in the absence of simultaneous multithreading.\n\t  However, current research has only demonstrated this flaw in\n\t  Hyper-Threading Technology, where shared memory caches are\n\t  used.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003ch1\u003eWorkaround\u003c/h1\u003e\n\t\u003cp\u003eSystems not using processors with Hyper-Threading Technology\n\t  support are not affected by this issue.  On systems which are\n\t  affected, the security flaw can be eliminated by setting the\n\t  \"machdep.hlt_logical_cpus\" tunable:\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003cpre\u003e# echo \"machdep.hlt_logical_cpus=1\" \u0026gt;\u0026gt; /boot/loader.conf\u003c/pre\u003e\n\t\u003cp\u003eThe system must be rebooted in order for tunables to take effect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003cp\u003eUse of this workaround is not recommended on \"dual-core\" systems, as\n\t  this workaround will also disable one of the processor\n\t  cores.\u003c/p\u003e\n      ",
