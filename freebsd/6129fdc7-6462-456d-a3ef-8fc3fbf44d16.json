Only\n\t    non-Windows clients are affected.  The vulnerability\n\t    only exists if (a) the client's TLS negotiation with\n\t    the server succeeds, (b) the server is malicious or\n\t    has been compromised such that it is configured to\n\t    push a maliciously crafted options string to the client,\n\t    and (c) the client indicates its willingness to accept\n\t    pushed options from the server by having \"pull\" or\n\t    \"client\" in its configuration file (Credit: Vade79).\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
