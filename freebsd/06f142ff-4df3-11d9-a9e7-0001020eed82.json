Malicious HTTP response or malicious HTML file can\n\t    redirect wget to a file that is vital to the system, and\n\t    wget will create/append/overwrite it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eWget apparently has at least two methods of\n\t    ``sanitizing'' the potentially malicious data it receives\n\t    from the HTTP stream, therefore a malicious redirects can\n\t    pass the check.  We haven't find a way to trick wget into\n\t    writing above the parent directory, which doesn't mean\n\t    it's not possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eMalicious HTTP response can overwrite parts of the\n\t    terminal so that the user will not notice anything wrong,\n\t    or will believe the error was not fatal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
