On systems that override the default and enable ntpdc\n\t    (mode 7) fuzz testing detected that  a short packet will cause\n\t    ntpd to read uninitialized data.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eNTP Bug 3596:  An unauthenticated unmonitored ntpd is vulnerable\n\t    to attack on IPv4 with highly predictable transmit timestamps. An\n\t    off-path attacker who can query time from the victim's ntp which\n\t    receives time from an unauthenticated time source must be able to\n\t    send from a spoofed IPv4 address of upstream ntp server and and\n\t    the victim must be able to process a large number of packets with\n\t    the spoofed IPv4 address of the upstream server.  After eight or\n\t    more successful attacks in a row the attacker can either modify\n\t    the victim's clock by a small amount or cause ntpd to terminate.\n\t    The attack is especially effective when unusually short poll\n\t    intervals have been configured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eNTP Bug 3592:  The fix for https://bugs.ntp.org/3445 introduced\n\t    a bug such that a ntp can be prevented from initiating a time\n\t    volley to its peer resulting in a DoS.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eAll three NTP bugs may result in DoS or terimation of the ntp\n\t    daemon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
