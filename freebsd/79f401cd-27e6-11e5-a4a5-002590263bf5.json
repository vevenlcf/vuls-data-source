Unless the device is an SR-IOV virtual function, after\n\t    disabling one or both of these bits subsequent accesses to the MMIO\n\t    or I/O port ranges would - on PCI Express devices - lead to\n\t    Unsupported Request responses. The treatment of such errors is\n\t    platform specific.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eFurthermore (at least) devices under control of the Linux pciback\n\t    driver in the host are handed to guests with the aforementioned bits\n\t    turned off.  This means that such accesses can similarly lead to\n\t    Unsupported Request responses until these flags are set as needed by\n\t    the guest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eIn the event that the platform surfaces aforementioned UR responses\n\t    as Non-Maskable Interrupts, and either the OS is configured to treat\n\t    NMIs as fatal or (e.g. via ACPI's APEI) the platform tells the OS to\n\t    treat these errors as fatal, the host would crash, leading to a\n\t    Denial of Service.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
