This\n\t    was actually fixed by Tokio Kikuchi as part of the fix for LP:\n\t    #775294 and intended for Mailman 2.1.15, but that fix wasn't\n\t    completely merged at the time.  The full fix also addresses the\n\t    admindb, and edithtml pages as well as the user options page and the\n\t    previously fixed admin pages.
