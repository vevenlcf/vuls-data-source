The payloads can be crafted by an attacker to hijack user sessions, poison cookies, perform clickjacking, and a multitude of other attacks depending on the architecture of the underlying system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003ch1\u003eHTTP header values do not have trailing OWS trimmed (High) (CVE-2019-15606)\u003c/h1\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eOptional whitespace should be trimmed from HTTP header values.

There are no known vulnerabilities addressed, but lax HTTP parsing has historically been a source of problems. Some commonly used sites are known to generate invalid HTTP headers, a --insecure-http-parser CLI option or insecureHTTPParser http option can be used if necessary for interoperability, but is not recommended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
