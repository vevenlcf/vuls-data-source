Two relatively new reports, one dealing with a DTLS\n\t    1.0/1.2 denial of service attack and the other a ciphertext attack on\n\t    ECC/DH operations. The last vulnerability listed was a public\n\t    disclosure of a previous attack on AMD devices fixed since wolfSSL\n\t    version 5.1.0. Coordination of the disclosure of the attack was done\n\t    responsibly, in cooperation with the researchers, waiting for the\n\t    public release of the attack details since it affects multiple\n\t    security libraries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
