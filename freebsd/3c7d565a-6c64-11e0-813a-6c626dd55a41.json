Sending the \"Async\" header with\n\t    the \"Application\" header during an Originate action, allows\n\t    authenticated manager users to execute shell commands.  Only\n\t    users with the \"system\" privilege should be able to do this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eOn systems that have the Asterisk Manager Interface, Skinny, SIP\n\t    over TCP, or the built in HTTP server enabled, it is possible for\n\t    an attacker to open as many connections to asterisk as he wishes.\n\t    This will cause Asterisk to run out of available file descriptors\n\t    and stop processing any new calls.  Additionally, disk space can\n\t    be exhausted as Asterisk logs failures to open new file\n\t    descriptors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
