  "description": "\n\t\u003cp\u003eMichael Gmelin and JÃ¶rg Scheinert has reported a remote\n\t  command execution vulnerability in portaudit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003cp\u003eAn attacker who can get the user to use a specially crafted\n\t  audit file will be able to run commands on the users system,\n\t  with the privileges of the user running running portaudit\n\t  (often root).\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003cp\u003eThe attack could e.g. happen through DNS hijacking or a man\n\t  in the middle attack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003cp\u003eNote that if the user has set up portaudit to run from\n\t  periodic this attack could happen without direct user\n\t  interaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003cp\u003eIn the FreeBSD Ports Collection (bsd.port.mk) the check for\n\t  vulnerable ports at install-time directly operates on the\n\t  auditfile and has the same vulnerability as portaudit.  As\n\t  the Ports Collection infrastructure does not have a version\n\t  number just be sure to have a Ports Collection new enough to\n\t  contain the fix for portaudit.  Note that this is \u003cem\u003eonly\u003c/em\u003e\n\t  a problem for users which has portaudit installed, as they will\n\t  not have the audit database installed or downloaded\n\t  otherwise.\u003c/p\u003e\n      ",
