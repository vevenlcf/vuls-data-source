  "description": "\n\t \u003cp\u003eThe mysql_real_connect function doesn't properly handle DNS replies\n\t   by copying the IP address into a buffer without any length checking.\n\t   A specially crafted DNS reply may therefore be used to cause a buffer\n\t   overflow on affected systems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t \u003cp\u003eNote that whether this issue can be exploitable depends on the\n\t   system library responsible for the gethostbyname function. The bug\n\t   finder, Lukasz Wojtow, explaines this with the following words:\u003c/p\u003e\n\t \u003cblockquote cite=\"http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=4017\"\u003e\n\t   \u003cp\u003eIn glibc there is a limitation for an IP address to have only 4\n\t     bytes (obviously), but generally speaking the length of the address\n\t     comes with a response for dns query (i know it sounds funny but\n\t     read rfc1035 if you don't believe). This bug can occur on libraries\n\t     where gethostbyname function takes length from dns's response\u003c/p\u003e\n\t \u003c/blockquote\u003e\n       ",
