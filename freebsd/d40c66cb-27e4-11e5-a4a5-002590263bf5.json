Other\n\t    toolstacks may be vulnerable however.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eThe vulnerability is exposed via HVM guests which have a PCI device\n\t    assigned to them. A malicious HVM guest in such a configuration can\n\t    mount a denial of service attack affecting the whole system via its\n\t    associated device model (qemu-dm).\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eA guest is able to trigger this hypercall via operations which it\n\t    is legitimately expected to perform, therefore running the device\n\t    model as a stub domain does not offer protection against the host\n\t    denial of service issue. However it does offer some protection\n\t    against secondary issues such as denial of service against dom0.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
