While this crash technically\n\t    occurs due to a configuration issue, as attempting to\n\t    receive a fax from a channel driver that only contains\n\t    textual information will never succeed, the likelihood\n\t    of having it occur is sufficiently high as to warrant\n\t    this advisory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
