[CVE-2016-9311]\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003cp\u003eAn exploitable configuration modification vulnerability\n\texists in the control mode (mode 6) functionality of ntpd.\n\tIf, against long-standing BCP recommendations, \"restrict\n\tdefault noquery ...\" is not specified, a specially crafted\n\tcontrol mode packet can set ntpd traps, providing information\n\tdisclosure and DDoS amplification, and unset ntpd traps,\n\tdisabling legitimate monitoring by an attacker from remote.\n\t[CVE-2016-9310]\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003cp\u003eAn attacker with access to the NTP broadcast domain can\n\tperiodically inject specially crafted broadcast mode NTP\n\tpackets into the broadcast domain which, while being logged\n\tby ntpd, can cause ntpd to reject broadcast mode packets\n\tfrom legitimate NTP broadcast servers. [CVE-2016-7427]\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003cp\u003eAn attacker with access to the NTP broadcast domain can\n\tsend specially crafted broadcast mode NTP packets to the\n\tbroadcast domain which, while being logged by ntpd, will\n\tcause ntpd to reject broadcast mode packets from legitimate\n\tNTP broadcast servers. [CVE-2016-7428]\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003cp\u003eOrigin timestamp problems were fixed in ntp 4.2.8p6.\n\tHowever, subsequent timestamp validation checks introduced\n\ta regression in the handling of some Zero origin timestamp\n\tchecks. [CVE-2016-7431]\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003cp\u003eIf ntpd is configured to allow mrulist query requests\n\tfrom a server that sends a crafted malicious packet, ntpd\n\twill crash on receipt of that crafted malicious mrulist\n\tquery packet. [CVE-2016-7434]\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003cp\u003eAn attacker who knows the sources (e.g., from an IPv4\n\trefid in server response) and knows the system is (mis)configured\n\tin this way can periodically send packets with spoofed\n\tsource address to keep the rate limiting activated and\n\tprevent ntpd from accepting valid responses from its sources.\n\t[CVE-2016-7426]\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003cp\u003eNtp Bug 2085 described a condition where the root delay\n\twas included twice, causing the jitter value to be higher\n\tthan expected. Due to a misinterpretation of a small-print\n\tvariable in The Book, the fix for this problem was incorrect,\n\tresulting in a root distance that did not include the peer\n\tdispersion. The calculations and formulas have been reviewed\n\tand reconciled, and the code has been updated accordingly.\n\t[CVE-2016-7433]\u003c/p\u003e\n      ",
