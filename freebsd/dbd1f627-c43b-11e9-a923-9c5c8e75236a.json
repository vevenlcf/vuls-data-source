The issue has been resolved by respecting that limit.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t    \u003cli\u003e The zip bomb vulnerability mitigated in 0.101.3 has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2019-12625. Unfortunately, a workaround for the zip-bomb mitigation was immediately identified. To remediate the zip-bomb scan time issue, a scan time limit has been introduced in 0.101.4. This limit now resolves ClamAV's vulnerability to CVE-2019-12625.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t  \u003c/ul\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
