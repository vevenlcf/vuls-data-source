In order to execute an attack, the attacker would have to\n\t  be able to influence the HTTP/1 responses that the Varnish Server\n\t  receives from its configured backends. A successful attack would cause\n\t  the Varnish Server to assert and automatically restart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
