This file is insecurely created in\n\t    /tmp and it's name is easily predictable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eIt is then easy for an attacker to create arbitrary files\n\t    in any directory that the user under which apache runs has\n\t    privileges to write.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e[...]\u003c/em\u003e once the target file is opened, there is a\n\t    race attack (although difficult to exploit) which can lead\n\t    to mod_dosevasive overwriting any file that the user under\n\t    which apache runs has privileges to write.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
