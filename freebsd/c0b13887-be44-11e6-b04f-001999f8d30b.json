Rather than\n\t  following RFC 3261 and stripping only spaces and horizontal\n\t  tabs, Asterisk treats any non-printable ASCII character\n\t  as if it were whitespace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eThis mostly does not pose a problem until Asterisk is\n\t  placed in tandem with an authenticating SIP proxy. In\n\t  such a case, a crafty combination of valid and invalid\n\t  To headers can cause a proxy to allow an INVITE request\n\t  into Asterisk without authentication since it believes\n\t  the request is an in-dialog request. However, because of\n\t  the bug described above, the request will look like an\n\t  out-of-dialog request to Asterisk. Asterisk will then\n\t  process the request as a new call. The result is that\n\t  Asterisk can process calls from unvetted sources without\n\t  any authentication.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eIf you do not use a proxy for authentication, then\n\t  this issue does not affect you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eIf your proxy is dialog-aware (meaning that the proxy\n\t  keeps track of what dialogs are currently valid), then\n\t  this issue does not affect you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eIf you use chan_pjsip instead of chan_sip, then this\n\t  issue does not affect you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
