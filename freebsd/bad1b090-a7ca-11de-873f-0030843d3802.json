A malicious user is therefore able to use cross site\n\t    request forgeries to add attacker controlled OpenID identities to\n\t    existing accounts. These OpenID identities can then be used to gain\n\t    access to the affected accounts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eThe OpenID module is not a compliant implementation of the OpenID\n\t    Authentication 2.0 specification. An implementation error allows a\n\t    user to access the account of another user when they share the same\n\t    OpenID 2.0 provider.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eFile uploads with certain extensions are not correctly processed by\n\t    the File API. This may lead to the creation of files that are\n\t    executable by Apache. The .htaccess that is saved into the files\n\t    directory by Drupal should normally prevent execution. The files are\n\t    only executable when the server is configured to ignore the directives\n\t    in the .htaccess file.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eDrupal doesn't regenerate the session ID when an anonymous user\n\t    follows the one time login link used to confirm email addresses and\n\t    reset forgotten passwords. This enables a malicious user to fix and\n\t    reuse the session id of a victim under certain circumstances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
