The sanitization\n\t  filter was not properly stripping invalid characters from URL schemes and\n\t  was therefore vulnerable to persistent XSS attacks anywhere Markdown was\n\t  supported.\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ch1\u003eCross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in search bar\u003c/h1\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eJosh Unger reported a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the\n    issue search bar. Usernames were not being properly HTML escaped inside the\n    author filter would could allow arbitrary script execution.\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ch1\u003eOpen redirect in repository git redirects\u003c/h1\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eEric Rafaloff via HackerOne reported that GitLab was vulnerable to an\n    open redirect vulnerability when redirecting requests for repository names\n    that include the git extension. GitLab was not properly removing dangerous\n    parameters from the params field before redirecting which could allow an\n    attacker to redirect users to arbitrary hosts.\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003ch1\u003eUsername changes could leave repositories behind\u003c/h1\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eAn internal code review discovered that a bug in the code that moves\n    repositories during a username change could potentially leave behind\n    projects, allowing an attacker who knows the previous username to\n    potentially steal the contents of repositories on instances that are not\n    configured with hashed namespaces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
