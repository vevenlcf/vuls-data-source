Subsequently\n\t    some of them got declared disaggregation safe, but for a small\n\t    subset this was not really correct: Their (mis-)use may result in\n\t    host lockups.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eAs a result, the potential security benefits of toolstack\n\t    disaggregation are not always fully realised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eDomains deliberately given partial management control may be able\n\t    to deny service to the entire host.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eAs a result, in a system designed to enhance security by radically\n\t    disaggregating the management, the security may be reduced.
