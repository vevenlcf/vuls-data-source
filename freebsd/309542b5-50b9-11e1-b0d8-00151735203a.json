Such email\n\t      addresses could look visually identical to other valid email\n\t      addresses, and an attacker could try to confuse other users\n\t      and be added to bugs he shouldn't have access to.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t    \u003cli\u003eCross-Site Request Forgery:\n\t       Due to a lack of validation of the Content-Type head when\n\t       making POST requests to jsonrpc.cgi, a possible CSRF\n\t       vulnerability was discovered.  If a user visits an HTML page\n\t       with some malicious JS code in it, an attacker could make\n\t       changes to a remote Bugzilla installation on behalf of the\n\t       victim's account by using the JSON-RPC API.  The user would\n\t       have had to be already logged in to the target site for the\n\t       vulnerability to work.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t  \u003c/ul\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eAll affected installations are encouraged to upgrade as soon as\n\t    possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
