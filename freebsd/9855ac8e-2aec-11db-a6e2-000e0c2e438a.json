The function which queries the\n\t      server uses a buffer of 20 bytes and one of 9 for storing\n\t      the category and ID strings received from the server while\n\t      the buffer which contains this server's response is 32768\n\t      bytes long.  Naturally for exploiting this bug the attacker\n\t      must have control of the freedb server specified in the\n\t      AlsaPlayer's configuration.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t  \u003c/ul\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\t\u003cp\u003eThese vulnerabilities could allow a remote attacker to\n\t  execute arbitrary code, possibly gaining access to the\n\t  system.\u003c/p\u003e\n      ",
