[CVE-2016-4957, Reported by\n\tNicolas Edet of Cisco]\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003cp\u003eAn attacker who knows the origin timestamp and can send\n\ta spoofed packet containing a CRYPTO-NAK to an ephemeral\n\tpeer target before any other response is sent can demobilize\n\tthat association. [CVE-2016-4953, Reported by Miroslav\n\tLichvar of Red Hat]\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003cp\u003eAn attacker who is able to spoof packets with correct\n\torigin timestamps from enough servers before the expected\n\tresponse packets arrive at the target machine can affect\n\tsome peer variables and, for example, cause a false leap\n\tindication to be set. [CVE-2016-4954, Reported by Jakub\n\tProkes of Red Hat]\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003cp\u003eAn attacker who is able to spoof a packet with a correct\n\torigin timestamp before the expected response packet arrives\n\tat the target machine can send a CRYPTO_NAK or a bad MAC\n\tand cause the association's peer variables to be cleared.\n\tIf this can be done often enough, it will prevent that\n\tassociation from working. [CVE-2016-4955, Reported by\n\tMiroslav Lichvar of Red Hat]\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003cp\u003eThe fix for NtpBug2978 does not cover broadcast associations,\n\tso broadcast clients can be triggered to flip into interleave\n\tmode.
