The previous fix was incomplete,\n\t     which addressed JSON.parse(user_input), but didnâ€™t address some other\n\t     styles of JSON parsing including JSON(user_input) and\n\t     JSON.parse(user_input, nil).\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eSee CVE-2013-0269 in detail. Note that the issue was exploitable to\n\t    cause a Denial of Service by creating many garbage-uncollectable\n\t    Symbol objects, but this kind of attack is no longer valid because\n\t    Symbol objects are now garbage-collectable. However, creating arbitrary\n\t    bjects may cause severe security consequences depending upon the\n\t    application code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003ePlease update the json gem to version 2.3.0 or later. You can use\n\t     gem update json to update it. If you are using bundler, please add\n\t     gem \"json\", \"\u0026gt;= 2.3.0\" to your Gemfile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
