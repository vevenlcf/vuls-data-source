When zgrep is applied on the\n\t\tattacker's chosen file name (for example, a crafted\n\t\tfile name), this can overwrite an attacker's content\n\t\tto an arbitrary attacker-selected file. This flaw\n\t\toccurs due to insufficient validation when processing\n\t\tfilenames with two or more newlines where selected\n\t\tcontent and the target file names are embedded in\n\t\tcrafted multi-line file names. This flaw allows a\n\t\tremote, low privileged attacker to force zgrep to\n\t\twrite arbitrary files on the system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
