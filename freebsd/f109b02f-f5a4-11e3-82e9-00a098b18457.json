Manager users can\n\t    execute arbitrary shell commands with the MixMonitor manager action.\n\t    Asterisk does not require system class authorization for a manager\n\t    user to use the MixMonitor action, so any manager user who is\n\t    permitted to use manager commands can potentially execute shell\n\t    commands as the user executing the Asterisk process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eExhaustion of Allowed Concurrent HTTP Connections.
