  "description": "\n\t\u003cp\u003eAny ElGamal sign+encrypt keys created by GnuPG contain a\n\t  cryptographic weakness that may allow someone to obtain\n\t  the private key. \u003cstrong\u003eThese keys should be considered\n\t  unusable and should be revoked.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003cp\u003eThe following summary was written by Werner Koch, GnuPG\n\t  author:\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003cblockquote cite=\"http://lists.gnupg.org/pipermail/gnupg-devel/2003-November/020570.html\"\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003ePhong Nguyen identified a severe bug in the way GnuPG\n\t    creates and uses ElGamal keys for signing.\tThis is\n\t    a significant security failure which can lead to a\n\t    compromise of almost all ElGamal keys used for signing.\n\t    Note that this is a real world vulnerability which will\n\t    reveal your private key within a few seconds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003e...\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003ePlease \u003cem\u003etake immediate action and revoke your ElGamal\n\t    signing keys\u003c/em\u003e.\tFurthermore you should take whatever\n\t    measures necessary to limit the damage done for signed or\n\t    encrypted documents using that key.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eNote that the standard keys as generated by GnuPG (DSA\n\t    and ElGamal encryption) as well as RSA keys are NOT\n\t    vulnerable.  Note also that ElGamal signing keys cannot\n\t    be generated without the use of a special flag to enable\n\t    hidden options and even then overriding a warning message\n\t    about this key type.  See below for details on how to\n\t    identify vulnerable keys.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
