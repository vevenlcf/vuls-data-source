Multiple vulnerabilities are possible if Drupal is\n\t    configured to allow .tar, .tar.gz, .bz2 or .tlz file uploads and\n\t    processes them. The latest versions of Drupal update Archive_Tar to\n\t    1.4.9 to mitigate the file processing vulnerabilities.\n\t  \u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
