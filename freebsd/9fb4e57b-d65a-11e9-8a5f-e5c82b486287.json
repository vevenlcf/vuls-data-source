Also, Kerberos\n\t    authentication is usually only attempted and used with servers that the\n\t    client has a previous association with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eCVE-2019-5482: TFTP small blocksize heap buffer overflow\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003elibcurl contains a heap buffer overflow in the function\n\t    (tftp_receive_packet()) that receives data from a TFTP server. It can\n\t    call recvfrom() with the default size for the buffer rather than with\n\t    the size that was used to allocate it. Thus, the content that might\n\t    overwrite the heap memory is controlled by the server.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eThis flaw is only triggered if the TFTP server sends an OACK without\n\t    the BLKSIZE option, when a BLKSIZE smaller than 512 bytes was requested\n\t    by the TFTP client. OACK is a TFTP extension and is not used by all\n\t    TFTP servers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eUsers choosing a smaller block size than default should be rare as the\n\t    primary use case for changing the size is to make it larger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eIt is rare for users to use TFTP across the Internet. It is most\n\t    commonly used within local networks. TFTP as a protocol is always\n\t    inherently insecure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eThis issue was introduced by the add of the TFTP BLKSIZE option\n\t    handling. It was previously incompletely fixed by an almost identical\n\t    issue called CVE-2019-5436.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
