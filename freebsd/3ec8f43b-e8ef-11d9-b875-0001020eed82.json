The stalled TCP connection my\n\t  be closed after some time by the other host.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003ch1\u003eWorkaround\u003c/h1\u003e\n\t\u003cp\u003eIn some cases it may be possible to defend against these\n\t  attacks by blocking the attack packets using a firewall.\n\t  Packets used to effect either of these attacks would have\n\t  spoofed source IP addresses.\u003c/p\u003e\n      ",
