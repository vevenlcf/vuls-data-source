  "description": "\n\t\u003cp\u003eCarlos Barros reports that mpg123 contains two buffer\n\t  overflows.  These vulnerabilities can potentially lead to\n\t  execution of arbitrary code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003cp\u003eThe first buffer overflow can occur when mpg123 parses a\n\t  URL with a user-name/password field that is more than 256\n\t  characters long.  This problem can be triggered either\n\t  locally or remotely via a specially crafted play list.  The\n\t  second potential buffer overflow may be triggered locally by\n\t  a specially crafted symlink to the mpg123 binary.  This\n\t  problem is not as serious, since mpg123 is not installed\n\t  setuid by default.\u003c/p\u003e\n      ",
