This value is used as an index in Flash.ocx\n\t    to reference an array of function pointers.  This can be\n\t    exploited via a specially crafted SWF file to cause\n\t    the index to reference memory that is under the attacker's\n\t    control, which causes Flash Player to use attacker\n\t    supplied values as function pointers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eSuccessful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary\n\t    code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
