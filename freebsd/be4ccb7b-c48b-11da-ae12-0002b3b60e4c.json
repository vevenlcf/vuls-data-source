It is possible to transmit\n\t    environment variables to client-side shell scripts.  There are some\n\t    filters in place to prevent obvious nonsense, however they don't\n\t    catch the good old LD_PRELOAD trick. All we need is to put a file\n\t    onto the client under a known location (e.g. by returning a\n\t    specially crafted document upon web access) and we have a remote\n\t    root exploit. But since the attack may only come from authenticated\n\t    servers, this threat is greatly reduced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
