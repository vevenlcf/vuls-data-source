These allocations are followed by\n\t    a loop that writes out of bounds. This can lead to corruption on\n\t    the heap of the Python process with attacker controlled float\n\t    data.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eThis issue was found by Ned Williamson.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
