The CGI program mishandles untrusted data when\n\t    printing responses to the browser. This makes the program\n\t    vulnerable to carefully crafted requests containing script\n\t    or HTML. If an attacker can lure an unsuspecting user to\n\t    visit carefully staged content, the attacker can use it to\n\t    redirect the user to his or her local Pubcookie login page\n\t    and attempt to exploit the XSS vulnerabilities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003e These vulnerabilities are classified as *critical* due\n\t    to the nature and purpose of the Pubcookie login server for\n\t    user authentication and Web Single Sign-on (SSO).
