Unlike a regular command,\n\t    pseudo-commands do not begin with a slash ('/'). The flaw is that\n\t    sudo's the matching code would only check against the list of\n\t    pseudo-commands if the user-specified command also contained no\n\t    slashes. As a result, if the user ran \"sudo ./sudoedit\" the normal\n\t    matching code path was followed, which uses stat(2) to verify that\n\t    the user-specified command matches the one in sudoers. In this\n\t    case, it would compare the \"./sudoedit\" specified by the user with\n\t    \"sudoedit\" from the sudoers file, resulting in a positive\n\t    match.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
