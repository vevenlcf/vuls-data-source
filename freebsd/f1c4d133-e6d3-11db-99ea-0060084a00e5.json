This made it easier\n\t    than necessary for man-in-the-middle attackers to retrieve by\n\t    several probing and guessing the first three characters of the\n\t    APOP secret, bringing brute forcing the remaining characters well\n\t    within reach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
