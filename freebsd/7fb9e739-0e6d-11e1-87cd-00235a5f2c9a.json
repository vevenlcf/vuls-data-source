When attempts are made to\n\t    view files within the malformed Zip file in Ark's default view,\n\t    the wrong file may be displayed due to incorrect construction of\n\t    the temporary file name.  Whilst this does not allow the wrong\n\t    file to be overwritten, after closing the default view, Ark will\n\t    then attempt to delete the temporary file which could result in\n\t    the deletion of the incorrect file.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
