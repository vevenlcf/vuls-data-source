It also fixes multiple privilege escalation issues,\n\t  including: CVE-2014-0061, CVE-2014-0062, CVE-2014-0063, CVE-2014-0064,\n\t  CVE-2014-0065, and CVE-2014-0066. More information on these issues can\n\t  be found on our security page and the security issue detail wiki page.\n\t \u003c/p\u003e\n\t \u003cp\u003e\n\t  With this release, we are also alerting users to a known security hole\n\t  that allows other users on the same machine to gain access to an\n\t  operating system account while it is doing \"make check\":\n\t  CVE-2014-0067. \"Make check\" is normally part of building PostgreSQL\n\t  from source code. As it is not possible to fix this issue without\n\t  causing significant issues to our testing infrastructure, a patch will\n\t  be released separately and publicly. Until then, users are strongly\n\t  advised not to run \"make check\" on machines where untrusted users have\n\t  accounts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
