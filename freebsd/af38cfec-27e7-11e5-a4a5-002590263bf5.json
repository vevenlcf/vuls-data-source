A bug in how this logic deals with accesses\n\t    spanning multiple fields allows the guest to write to the host MSI\n\t    message data field.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eWhile generally the writes write back the values previously read,\n\t    their value in config space may have got changed by the host between\n\t    the qemu read and write. In such a case host side interrupt handling\n\t    could become confused, possibly losing interrupts or allowing\n\t    spurious interrupt injection into other guests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eCertain untrusted guest administrators may be able to confuse host\n\t    side interrupt handling, leading to a Denial of Service.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
