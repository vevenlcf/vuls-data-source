  "description": "\n\t\u003cp\u003eStefan Esser of e-matters found almost a dozen remotely\n\t  exploitable vulnerabilities in Gaim.\tFrom the e-matters\n\t  advisory:\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003cblockquote cite=\"http://security.e-matters.de/advisories/012004.txt\"\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eWhile developing a custom add-on, an integer overflow\n\t  in the handling of AIM DirectIM packets was revealed that\n\t  could lead to a remote compromise of the IM client. After\n\t  disclosing this bug to the vendor, they had to make a\n\t  hurried release because of a change in the Yahoo connection\n\t  procedure that rendered GAIM useless. Unfourtunately at the\n\t  same time a closer look onto the sourcecode revealed 11 more\n\t  vulnerabilities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\t  \u003cp\u003eThe 12 identified problems range from simple standard\n\t  stack overflows, over heap overflows to an integer overflow\n\t  that can be abused to cause a heap overflow. Due to the\n\t  nature of instant messaging many of these bugs require\n\t  man-in-the-middle attacks between client and server. But the\n\t  underlying protocols are easy to implement and MIM attacks\n\t  on ordinary TCP sessions is a fairly simple task.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\t  \u003cp\u003eIn combination with the latest kernel vulnerabilities or\n\t  the habit of users to work as root/administrator these bugs\n\t  can result in remote root compromises.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
