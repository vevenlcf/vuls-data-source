Depending on the value of the\n\t    uninitialized portion of the IPv6 address, it is possible for the\n\t    IPv4 network number to match when it should not. This bug only\n\t    affects IP network matching and does not affect simple IP address\n\t    matching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eThe reported configuration that exhibited the bug was an\n\t    LDAP-based sudo installation where the sudoRole object contained\n\t    multiple sudoHost entries, each containing a different IPv4\n\t    network. File-based sudoers should be affected as well as the\n\t    same matching code is used.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
