Since up-imapproxy runs in a single process with each\n\t    connection handled in a separate thread, any crash kills\n\t    all the connections and stops listening for new ones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eIn 64bit systems it might be possible to make it leak\n\t    data (mails, passwords, ..) from other connections to\n\t    attacker's connection. However I don't think up-imapproxy\n\t    actually works in any 64bit system so this is just a\n\t    theoretical problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
