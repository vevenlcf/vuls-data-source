This can cause carefully crafted emails that\n\t    might take more scan time than expected leading to a Denial of\n\t    Service.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eFix a reliance on \".\" in @INC in one configuration script.  Whether\n\t    this can be exploited in any way is uncertain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eFix a potential Remote Code Execution bug with the PDFInfo plugin.\n\t    Thanks to cPanel Security Team for their report of this issue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003e Fourth, this release fixes a local user code injection in the\n\t    meta rule syntax.
