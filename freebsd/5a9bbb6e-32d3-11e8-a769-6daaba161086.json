This debugger service was vulnerable to a DNS rebinding attack which could be exploited to perform remote code execution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003ch1\u003e'path' module regular expression denial of service (CVE-2018-7158)\u003c/h1\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eThe 'path' module in the Node.js 4.x release line contains a potential regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) vector. The code in question was replaced in Node.js 6.x and later so this vulnerability only impacts all versions of Node.js 4.x.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003ch1\u003eSpaces in HTTP Content-Length header values are ignored (CVE-2018-7159)\u003c/h1\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eThe HTTP parser in all current versions of Node.js ignores spaces in the Content-Length header, allowing input such as Content-Length: 1 2 to be interpreted as having a value of 12. The HTTP specification does not allow for spaces in the Content-Length value and the Node.js HTTP parser has been brought into line on this particular difference.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
