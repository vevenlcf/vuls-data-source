Subsequent formulas can operate on\n\t     that inserted data and construct a remote URL whose path leaks the local\n\t     data to a remote attacker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eIn later versions of LibreOffice without this flaw, WEBSERVICE has now\n\t     been limited to accessing http and https URLs along with bringing\n\t     WEBSERVICE URLs under LibreOffice Calc's link management infrastructure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t   \u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNote:\u003c/strong\u003e This vulnerability has been identified upstream\n\t     as CVE-2018-1055, but NVD/Mitre are advising it's a reservation\n\t     duplicate of CVE-2018-6871 which should be used instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
