This issue was partially\n\taddressed in FreeBSD-SA-16:25.bspatch, but some possible\n\tinteger overflows remained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003ch1\u003eImpact:\u003c/h1\u003e\n\t\u003cp\u003eAn attacker who can control the patch file can cause a\n\tcrash or run arbitrary code under the credentials of the\n\tuser who runs bspatch, in many cases, root.\u003c/p\u003e\n      ",
