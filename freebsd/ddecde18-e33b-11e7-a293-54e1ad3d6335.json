Properly chosen values allow an overflow which in\n\t    turn will lead to less allocated memory than needed for subsequent\n\t    reads.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eThe signedness bug is triggered by reading the length of a comment\n\t    as unsigned int, but casting it to int when calling the function\n\t    XcursorCommentCreate. Turning length into a negative value allows\n\t    the check against XCURSOR_COMMENT_MAX_LEN to pass, and the following\n\t    addition of sizeof (XcursorComment) + 1 makes it possible to\n\t    allocate less memory than needed for subsequent reads.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
