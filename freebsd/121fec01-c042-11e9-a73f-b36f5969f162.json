Specially crafted\n\t    HTTP/2 frames cause Denial of Service by consuming CPU time. Check out\n\t    https://github.com/Netflix/security-bulletins/blob/master/advisories/third-party/2019-002.md\n\t    for details. For nghttpx, additionally limiting inbound traffic by\n\t    --read-rate and --read-burst options is quite effective against this\n\t    kind of attack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eCVE-2019-9511 \"Data Dribble\": The attacker requests a large amount of\n\t    data from a specified resource over multiple streams. They manipulate\n\t    window size and stream priority to force the server to queue the data in\n\t    1-byte chunks. Depending on how efficiently this data is queued, this\n\t    can consume excess CPU, memory, or both, potentially leading to a\n\t    denial of service.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eCVE-2019-9513 \"Ping Flood\": The attacker sends continual pings to an\n\t    HTTP/2 peer, causing the peer to build an internal queue of responses.\n\t    Depending on how efficiently this data is queued, this can consume\n\t    excess CPU, memory, or both, potentially leading to a denial of service.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
