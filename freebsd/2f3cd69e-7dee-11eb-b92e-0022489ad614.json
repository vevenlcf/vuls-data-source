This leads to a leak of file descriptors. If a file descriptor limit is configured on the system, then the server is unable to accept new connections and prevent the process also from opening, e.g. a file. If no file descriptor limit is configured, then this lead to an excessive memory usage and cause the system to run out of memory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003ch1\u003eDNS rebinding in --inspect (CVE-2021-22884)\u003c/h1\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eAffected Node.js versions are vulnerable to a DNS rebinding attack when the whitelist includes \"localhost6\". When \"localhost6\" is not present in /etc/hosts, it is just an ordinary domain that is resolved via DNS, i.e., over network. If the attacker controls the victim's DNS server or can spoof its responses, the DNS rebinding protection can be bypassed by using the \"localhost6\" domain. As long as the attacker uses the \"localhost6\" domain, they can still apply the attack described in CVE-2018-7160.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003ch1\u003eOpenSSL - Integer overflow in CipherUpdate (CVE-2021-23840)\u003c/h1\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eThis is a vulnerability in OpenSSL which may be exploited through Node.js.
