[CVE-2014-3508]\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eThe issue affects OpenSSL clients and allows a malicious\n\t    server to crash the client with a null pointer dereference\n\t    (read) by specifying an SRP ciphersuite even though it was\n\t    not properly negotiated with the client. [CVE-2014-5139]\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eIf a multithreaded client connects to a malicious server\n\t    using a resumed session and the server sends an ec point\n\t    format extension it could write up to 255 bytes to freed\n\t    memory. [CVE-2014-3509]\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eAn attacker can force an error condition which causes\n\t    openssl to crash whilst processing DTLS packets due to\n\t    memory being freed twice. This can be exploited through\n\t    a Denial of Service attack. [CVE-2014-3505]\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eAn attacker can force openssl to consume large amounts\n\t    of memory whilst processing DTLS handshake messages.\n\t    This can be exploited through a Denial of Service\n\t    attack. [CVE-2014-3506]\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eBy sending carefully crafted DTLS packets an attacker\n\t    could cause openssl to leak memory. This can be exploited\n\t    through a Denial of Service attack. [CVE-2014-3507]\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eOpenSSL DTLS clients enabling anonymous (EC)DH\n\t    ciphersuites are subject to a denial of service attack.\n\t    A malicious server can crash the client with a null pointer\n\t    dereference (read) by specifying an anonymous (EC)DH\n\t    ciphersuite and sending carefully crafted handshake\n\t    messages. [CVE-2014-3510]\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eA flaw in the OpenSSL SSL/TLS server code causes the\n\t    server to negotiate TLS 1.0 instead of higher protocol\n\t    versions when the ClientHello message is badly\n\t    fragmented. This allows a man-in-the-middle attacker\n\t    to force a downgrade to TLS 1.0 even if both the server\n\t    and the client support a higher protocol version, by\n\t    modifying the client's TLS records. [CVE-2014-3511]\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eA malicious client or server can send invalid SRP\n\t    parameters and overrun an internal buffer.  Only\n\t    applications which are explicitly set up for SRP\n\t    use are affected. [CVE-2014-3512]\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
