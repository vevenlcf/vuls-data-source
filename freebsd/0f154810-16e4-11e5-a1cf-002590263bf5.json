But it will also\n\t    pass the spoof check, because a file named .html and containing\n\t    actual HTML passes the spoof check.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eThis change makes it so that we also check the supplied content\n\t    type. So even if the file contains HTML and ends with .html, it\n\t    doesn't match the content type of `image/jpeg` and so it fails.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
