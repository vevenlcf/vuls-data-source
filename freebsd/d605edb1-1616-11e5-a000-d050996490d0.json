Under certain\n\t    circumstances, malicious users can use this parameter to\n\t    construct a URL that will trick users into being redirected\n\t    to a 3rd party website, thereby exposing the users to potential\n\t    social engineering attacks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that only sites\n\t    with the Field UI module enabled are affected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eDrupal 6 core is not affected, but see the similar advisory\n\t    for the Drupal 6 contributed CCK module:\n\t    \u003ca href=\"https://www.drupal.org/node/2507753\"\u003eSA-CONTRIB-2015-126\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003ch3\u003eOpen redirect (Overlay module - Drupal 7 - Less critical)\u003c/h3\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eThe Overlay module displays administrative pages as a layer\n\t    over the current page (using JavaScript), rather than replacing\n\t    the page in the browser window. The Overlay module does not\n\t    sufficiently validate URLs prior to displaying their contents,\n\t    leading to an open redirect vulnerability.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that it can only\n\t    be used against site users who have the \"Access the administrative\n\t    overlay\" permission, and that the Overlay module must be enabled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003ch3\u003eInformation disclosure (Render cache system - Drupal 7\n\t    - Less critical)\u003c/h3\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eOn sites utilizing Drupal 7's render cache system to cache\n\t    content on the site by user role, private content viewed by\n\t    user 1 may be included in the cache and exposed to non-privileged\n\t    users.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that render caching\n\t    is not used in Drupal 7 core itself (it requires custom code or\n\t    the contributed \u003ca href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/render_cache\"\u003eRender\n\t      Cache\u003c/a\u003e module to enable) and that it only affects sites that\n\t    have user 1 browsing the live site. Exposure is also limited if an\n\t    administrative role has been assigned to the user 1 account (which\n\t    is done, for example, by the Standard install profile that ships\n\t    with Drupal core).\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
