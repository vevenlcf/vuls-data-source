When the email is viewed\n\t    by the victim, the attacker gains full control over the\n\t    session of the victim and can steal any of their emails,\n\t    including those that contain highly sensitive information\n\t    such as passwords, documents, and password reset links.\n\t  \u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
