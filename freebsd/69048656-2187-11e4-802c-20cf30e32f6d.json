These\n\t    APIs return the information as NUL terminated strings (commonly called C\n\t    strings).  X.509 uses counted length strings which may include a NUL byte.\n\t    This means that a library user will interpret any information as ending\n\t    upon seeing this NUL byte and will only see a partial value for that field.\n\t  \u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eAttackers could exploit this vulnerability to create a certificate that a\n\t    client will accept for a different hostname than the full certificate is\n\t    actually for by embedding a NUL byte in the certificate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eThis can lead to a man-in-the-middle attack.  There are no known instances\n\t    of this problem being exploited in the wild and in practice it should be\n\t    difficult to actually exploit this vulnerability.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
