This can cause\n\t    the daemon to crash or induce the execution of arbitrary code\n\t    (which is believed to be difficult).  No exploit that executes\n\t    arbitrary code is known to exist, but it is easy to trigger a\n\t    denial of service manually.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eSome platforms detect attempted freeing of invalid pointers and\n\t    protectively terminate the process, preventing arbitrary code\n\t    execution on those platforms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
