Specially crafted requests may trick Opera\n\t    into thinking that the target site has given permission when it\n\t    had not done so. This can result in the contents of any target page\n\t    being revealed to untrusted sites, including any\n\t    sensitive information or session IDs contained within the\n\t    source of those pages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\t\u003cp\u003eAlso reported are vulnerabilities involving SVG graphics and XSS.\u003c/p\u003e\n      ",
