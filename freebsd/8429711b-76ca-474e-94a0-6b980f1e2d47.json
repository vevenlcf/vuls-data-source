Microsoft Vulnerability Research\n\t      extended this attack to browser JavaScript engines and\n\t      demonstrated that code on a malicious web page could\n\t      read data from other web sites (violating the\n\t      same-origin policy) or private data from the browser\n\t      itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t    \u003cp\u003eSince this new class of attacks involves measuring\n\t      precise time intervals, as a parti al, short-term,\n\t      mitigation we are disabling or reducing the precision of\n\t      several time sources in Firefox. The precision of\n\t      \u003ccode\u003eperformance.now()\u003c/code\u003e has been reduced from 5μs\n\t      to 20μs, and the \u003ccode\u003eSharedArrayBuffer\u003c/code\u003e feature\n\t      has been disabled because it can be used to construct a\n\t      high-resolution timer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
