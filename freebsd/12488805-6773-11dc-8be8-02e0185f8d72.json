These vulnerabilities are\n\t  caused by improper checking of the log variable in \"viewlog.php\"\n\t  and improper checking of the referer variable in \"mode.php\".\n\t  This could allow local file inclusion, potentially disclosing\n\t  valuable information and could lead to an attacker conducting\n\t  a cross site scripting attack against the targeted site.\u003c/p\u003e\n      ",
