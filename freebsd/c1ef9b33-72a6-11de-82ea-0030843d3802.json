In certain cases after a\n\t    return from a native function, such as escape(), the Just-in-Time\n\t    (JIT) compiler could get into a corrupt state. This could be exploited\n\t    by an attacker to run arbitrary code such as installing malware.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eThis vulnerability does not affect earlier versions of Firefox\n\t    which do not support the JIT feature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
