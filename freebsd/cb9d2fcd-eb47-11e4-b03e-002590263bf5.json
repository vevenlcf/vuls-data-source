SSID\n\t    field has valid length range of 0-32 octets. However, it is transmitted\n\t    in an element that has a 8-bit length field and potential maximum\n\t    payload length of 255 octets. wpa_supplicant was not sufficiently\n\t    verifying the payload length on one of the code paths using the SSID\n\t    received from a peer device.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eThis can result in copying arbitrary data from an attacker to a fixed\n\t    length buffer of 32 bytes (i.e., a possible overflow of up to 223\n\t    bytes). The SSID buffer is within struct p2p_device that is allocated\n\t    from heap. The overflow can override couple of variables in the struct,\n\t    including a pointer that gets freed. In addition about 150 bytes (the\n\t    exact length depending on architecture) can be written beyond the end of\n\t    the heap allocation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eThis could result in corrupted state in heap, unexpected program\n\t    behavior due to corrupted P2P peer device information, denial of service\n\t    due to wpa_supplicant process crash, exposure of memory contents during\n\t    GO Negotiation, and potentially arbitrary code execution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eVulnerable versions/configurations\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003ewpa_supplicant v1.0-v2.4 with CONFIG_P2P build option enabled\n\t    (which is not compiled by default).\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eAttacker (or a system controlled by the attacker) needs to be within\n\t    radio range of the vulnerable system to send a suitably constructed\n\t    management frame that triggers a P2P peer device information to be\n\t    created or updated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eThe vulnerability is easiest to exploit while the device has started an\n\t    active P2P operation (e.g., has ongoing P2P_FIND or P2P_LISTEN control\n\t    interface command in progress). However, it may be possible, though\n\t    significantly more difficult, to trigger this even without any active\n\t    P2P operation in progress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
