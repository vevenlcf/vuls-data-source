The vulnerabilities apply to those points:\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003col\u003e\n\t    \u003cli\u003ecss/phpmyadmin.css.php was vulnerable against\n\t      \u003ccode\u003e$cfg\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003eGLOBALS\u003c/code\u003e variable\n\t      injections. This way, a possible attacker could\n\t      manipulate any configuration parameter. Using\n\t      phpMyAdmin's theming mechanism, he was able to include\n\t      arbitrary files. This is especially dangerous if php is\n\t      not running in safe mode.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t    \u003cli\u003eA possible attacker could manipulate phpMyAdmin's\n\t      localized strings via the URL and inject harmful\n\t      JavaScript code this way, which could be used for XSS\n\t      attacks.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t  \u003c/ol\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
