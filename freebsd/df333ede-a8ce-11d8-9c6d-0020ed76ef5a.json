  "description": "\n\t\u003cp\u003eKarol Wiesek and Greg MacManus reported via iDEFENSE that the\n\t  Opera web browser contains a flaw in the handling of\n\t  certain URIs.  When presented with these URIs, Opera would\n\t  invoke external commands to process them after some\n\t  validation.  However, if the hostname component of a URI\n\t  begins with a `-', it may be treated as an option by an external\n\t  command.  This could have undesirable side-effects, from\n\t  denial-of-service to code execution.\tThe impact is very\n\t  dependent on local configuration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003cp\u003eAfter the iDEFENSE advisory was published, the KDE team\n\t  discovered similar problems in KDE's URI handlers.\u003c/p\u003e\n      ",
