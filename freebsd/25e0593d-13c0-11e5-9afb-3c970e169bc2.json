There was no limit to the size of\n\t    request body that Tomcat would swallow. This permitted\n\t    a limited Denial of Service as Tomcat would never close\n\t    the connection and a processing thread would remain\n\t    allocated to the connection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eModerate: Security Manager bypass CVE-2014-7810\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eMalicious web applications could use expression\n\t    language to bypass the protections of a Security\n\t    Manager as expressions were evaluated within a\n\t    privileged code section.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n      ",
