When an endpoint sends an SDP offer\n\t  that only lists codecs not allowed by Asterisk, the offer\n\t  is rejected. However, in this case, RTP ports that are\n\t  allocated in the process are not reclaimed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003cp\u003eThis issue only affects the PJSIP channel driver in\n\t  Asterisk.
