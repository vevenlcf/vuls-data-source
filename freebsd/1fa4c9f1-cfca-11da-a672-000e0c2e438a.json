As a result of this\n\t  discrepancy remaining unnoticed until now, the FreeBSD kernel\n\t  does not restore the contents of the FOP, FIP, and FDP\n\t  registers between context switches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003ch1\u003eImpact\u003c/h1\u003e\n\t\u003cp\u003eOn affected processors, a local attacker can monitor the\n\t  execution path of a process which uses floating-point\n\t  operations.  This may allow an attacker to steal\n\t  cryptographic keys or other sensitive information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003ch1\u003eWorkaround\u003c/h1\u003e\n\t\u003cp\u003eNo workaround is available, but systems which do not use AMD\n\t  Athlon, Duron, Athlon MP, Athlon XP, Athlon64, Athlon64 FX,\n\t  Opteron, Turion, or Sempron processors are not vulnerable.\u003c/p\u003e\n      ",
