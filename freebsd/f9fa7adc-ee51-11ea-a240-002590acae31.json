  "description": "\n\t\u003cp\u003eImporting an OpenPGP key having a preference list for AEAD algorithms\n\twill lead to an array overflow and thus often to a crash or other\n\tundefined behaviour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\t\u003cp\u003eImporting an arbitrary key can often easily be triggered by an attacker\n\tand thus triggering this bug.  Exploiting the bug aside from crashes is\n\tnot trivial but likely possible for a dedicated attacker.  The major\n\thurdle for an attacker is that only every second byte is under their\n\tcontrol with every first byte having a fixed value of 0x04.\u003c/p\u003e\n      ",
