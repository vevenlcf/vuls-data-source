  "description": "\n\tThe JavaScript for Acrobat API in Adobe Reader and Acrobat 7.x before 7.1.4, 8.x before 8.1.7, and 9.x before 9.2 does not properly implement the (1) Privileged Context and (2) Safe Path restrictions for unspecified JavaScript methods, which allows remote attackers to create arbitrary files, and possibly execute arbitrary code, via the cPath parameter in a crafted PDF file.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.\n\t",
