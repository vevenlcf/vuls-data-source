  "description": "\n    Unspecified vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) component in Oracle Java SE 7 Update 21 and earlier and 6 Update 45 and earlier, and OpenJDK 7, allows local users to affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability via unknown vectors related to Networking.  NOTE: the previous information is from the June 2013 CPU. Oracle has not commented on claims from another vendor that this issue is related to improper enforcement of exclusive port binds when running on Windows, which allows attackers to bind to ports that are already in use.\n    ",
