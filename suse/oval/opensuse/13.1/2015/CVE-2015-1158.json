  "description": "\n    The add_job function in scheduler/ipp.c in cupsd in CUPS before 2.0.3 performs incorrect free operations for multiple-value job-originating-host-name attributes, which allows remote attackers to trigger data corruption for reference-counted strings via a crafted (1) IPP_CREATE_JOB or (2) IPP_PRINT_JOB request, as demonstrated by replacing the configuration file and consequently executing arbitrary code.\n    ",
