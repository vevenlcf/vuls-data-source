  "description": "\n    The do_item_get function in items.c in memcached 1.4.4 and other versions before 1.4.17, when running in verbose mode, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (segmentation fault) via a request to delete a key, which does not account for the lack of a null terminator in the key and triggers a buffer over-read when printing to stderr, a different vulnerability than CVE-2013-0179.\n    ",
