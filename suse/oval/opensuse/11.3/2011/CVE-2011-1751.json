  "description": "\n\tThe pciej_write function in hw/acpi_piix4.c in the PIIX4 Power Management emulation in qemu-kvm does not check if a device is hotpluggable before unplugging the PCI-ISA bridge, which allows privileged guest users to cause a denial of service (guest crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code by sending a crafted value to the 0xae08 (PCI_EJ_BASE) I/O port, which leads to a use-after-free related to \"active qemu timers.\"\n\t",
