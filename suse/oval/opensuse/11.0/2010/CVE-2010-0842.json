  "description": "\n\tUnspecified vulnerability in the Sound component in Oracle Java SE and Java for Business 6 Update 18, 5.0 Update 23, 1.4.2_25, and 1.3.1_27 allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability via unknown vectors.  NOTE: the previous information was obtained from the March 2010 CPU.  Oracle has not commented on claims from a reliable researcher that this is an uncontrolled array index that allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a MIDI file with a crafted MixerSequencer object, related to the GM_Song structure.\n\t",
