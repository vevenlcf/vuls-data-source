  "description": "\n    An issue was discovered in phpMyAdmin 4.8.x before 4.8.2, in which an attacker can include (view and potentially execute) files on the server. The vulnerability comes from a portion of code where pages are redirected and loaded within phpMyAdmin, and an improper test for whitelisted pages. An attacker must be authenticated, except in the \"$cfg['AllowArbitraryServer'] = true\" case (where an attacker can specify any host he/she is already in control of, and execute arbitrary code on phpMyAdmin) and the \"$cfg['ServerDefault'] = 0\" case (which bypasses the login requirement and runs the vulnerable code without any authentication).\n    ",
