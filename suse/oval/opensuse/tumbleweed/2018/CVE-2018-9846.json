  "description": "\n    In Roundcube from versions 1.2.0 to 1.3.5, with the archive plugin enabled and configured, it's possible to exploit the unsanitized, user-controlled \"_uid\" parameter (in an archive.php _task=mail\u0026_mbox=INBOX\u0026_action=plugin.move2archive request) to perform an MX (IMAP) injection attack by placing an IMAP command after a %0d%0a sequence. NOTE: this is less easily exploitable in 1.3.4 and later because of a Same Origin Policy protection mechanism.\n    ",
