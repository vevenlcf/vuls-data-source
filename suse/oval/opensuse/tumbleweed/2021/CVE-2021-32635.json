  "description": "\n    Singularity is an open source container platform. In verions 3.7.2 and 3.7.3, Dde to incorrect use of a default URL, `singularity` action commands (`run`/`shell`/`exec`) specifying a container using a `library://` URI will always attempt to retrieve the container from the default remote endpoint (`cloud.sylabs.io`) rather than the configured remote endpoint. An attacker may be able to push a malicious container to the default remote endpoint with a URI that is identical to the URI used by a victim with a non-default remote endpoint, thus executing the malicious container. Only action commands (`run`/`shell`/`exec`) against `library://` URIs are affected. Other commands such as `pull` / `push` respect the configured remote endpoint. The vulnerability is patched in Singularity version 3.7.4. Two possible workarounds exist: Users can only interact with the default remote endpoint, or an installation can have an execution control list configured to restrict execution to containers signed with specific secure keys.\n    ",
