  "description": "\n    Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. There is a typo in TensorFlow's `SpecializeType` which results in heap OOB read/write. Due to a typo, `arg` is initialized to the `i`th mutable argument in a loop where the loop index is `j`. Hence it is possible to assign to `arg` from outside the vector of arguments. Since this is a mutable proto value, it allows both read and write to outside of bounds data. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, and TensorFlow 2.6.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n    ",
