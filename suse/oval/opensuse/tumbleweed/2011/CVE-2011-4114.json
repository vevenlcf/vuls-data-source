  "description": "\n    The par_mktmpdir function in the PAR::Packer module before 1.012 for Perl creates temporary files in a directory with a predictable name without verifying ownership and permissions of this directory, which allows local users to overwrite files when another user extracts a PAR packed program.  NOTE: a similar vulnerability was reported for PAR, but this has been assigned a different CVE identifier.\n    ",
