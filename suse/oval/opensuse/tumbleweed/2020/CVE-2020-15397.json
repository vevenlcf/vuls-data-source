  "description": "\n    HylaFAX+ through 7.0.2 and HylaFAX Enterprise have scripts that execute binaries from directories writable by unprivileged users (e.g., locations under /var/spool/hylafax that are writable by the uucp account). This allows these users to execute code in the context of the user calling these binaries (often root).\n    ",
