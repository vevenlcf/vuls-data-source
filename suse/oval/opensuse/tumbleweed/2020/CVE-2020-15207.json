  "description": "\n    In tensorflow-lite before versions 1.15.4, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.2.1 and 2.3.1, to mimic Python's indexing with negative values, TFLite uses `ResolveAxis` to convert negative values to positive indices. However, the only check that the converted index is now valid is only present in debug builds. If the `DCHECK` does not trigger, then code execution moves ahead with a negative index. This, in turn, results in accessing data out of bounds which results in segfaults and/or data corruption. The issue is patched in commit 2d88f470dea2671b430884260f3626b1fe99830a, and is released in TensorFlow versions 1.15.4, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.2.1, or 2.3.1.\n    ",
