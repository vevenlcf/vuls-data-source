  "description": "\n\tThe Adobe Macromedia Flash 9 plug-in allows remote attackers to cause a victim machine to establish TCP sessions with arbitrary hosts via a Flash (SWF) movie, related to lack of pinning of a hostname to a single IP address after receiving an allow-access-from element in a cross-domain-policy XML document, and the availability of a Flash Socket class that does not use the browser's DNS pins, aka DNS rebinding attacks, a different issue than CVE-2002-1467 and CVE-2007-4324.\n\t",
