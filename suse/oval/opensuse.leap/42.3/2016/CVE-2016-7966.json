  "description": "\n    Through a malicious URL that contained a quote character it was possible to inject HTML code in KMail's plaintext viewer. Due to the parser used on the URL it was not possible to include the equal sign (=) or a space into the injected HTML, which greatly reduces the available HTML functionality. Although it is possible to include an HTML comment indicator to hide content.\n    ",
