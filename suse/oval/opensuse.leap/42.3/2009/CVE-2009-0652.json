  "description": "\n    The Internationalized Domain Names (IDN) blacklist in Mozilla Firefox 3.0.6 and other versions before 3.0.9; Thunderbird before 2.0.0.21; and SeaMonkey before 1.1.15 does not include box-drawing characters, which allows remote attackers to spoof URLs and conduct phishing attacks, as demonstrated by homoglyphs of the / (slash) and ? (question mark) characters in a subdomain of a .cn domain name, a different vulnerability than CVE-2005-0233.  NOTE: some third parties claim that 3.0.6 is not affected, but much older versions perhaps are affected.\n    ",
