  "description": "\n    A flaw was found in the way Ansible (2.3.x before 2.3.3, and 2.4.x before 2.4.1) passed certain parameters to the jenkins_plugin module. Remote attackers could use this flaw to expose sensitive information from a remote host's logs. This flaw was fixed by not allowing passwords to be specified in the \"params\" argument, and noting this in the module documentation.\n    ",
