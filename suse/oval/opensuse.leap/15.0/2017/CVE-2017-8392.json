  "description": "\n    The Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.28, is vulnerable to an invalid read of size 8 because of missing a check to determine whether symbols are NULL in the _bfd_dwarf2_find_nearest_line function. This vulnerability causes programs that conduct an analysis of binary programs using the libbfd library, such as objdump, to crash.\n    ",
