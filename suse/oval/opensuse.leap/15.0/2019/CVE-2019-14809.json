  "description": "\n    net/url in Go before 1.11.13 and 1.12.x before 1.12.8 mishandles malformed hosts in URLs, leading to an authorization bypass in some applications. This is related to a Host field with a suffix appearing in neither Hostname() nor Port(), and is related to a non-numeric port number. For example, an attacker can compose a crafted javascript:// URL that results in a hostname of google.com.\n    ",
