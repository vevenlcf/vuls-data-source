  "description": "\n    Hardlink before 0.1.2 has multiple integer overflows leading to heap-based buffer overflows because of the way string lengths concatenation is done in the calculation of the required memory space to be used. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted directory tree and trick the local user into consolidating it, leading to hardlink executable crash or potentially arbitrary code execution with user privileges.\n    ",
