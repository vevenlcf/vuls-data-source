  "description": "\n\tThe _compile function in Maketext.pm in the Locale::Maketext implementation in Perl before 5.17.7 does not properly handle backslashes and fully qualified method names during compilation of bracket notation, which allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary commands via crafted input to an application that accepts translation strings from users, as demonstrated by the TWiki application before 5.1.3, and the Foswiki application 1.0.x through 1.0.10 and 1.1.x through 1.1.6.\n\t",
