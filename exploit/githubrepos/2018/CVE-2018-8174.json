In this case, the malvertisements have a hidden iframe that redirects victims to Rig’s landing page,  which includes an exploit for CVE-2018-8174 and shellcode.  This enables remote code execution of the shellcode obfuscated in the landing page.  After successful exploitation, a second-stage downloader is retrieved,  which appears to be a variant of SmokeLoader due to the URL.  It would then download the final payload, a Monero miner.",
