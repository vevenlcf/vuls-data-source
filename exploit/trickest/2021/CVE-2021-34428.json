  "description": " For Eclipse Jetty versions \u003c= 9.4.40, \u003c= 10.0.2, \u003c= 11.0.2, if an exception is thrown from the SessionListener#sessionDestroyed() method, then the session ID is not invalidated in the session ID manager. On deployments with clustered sessions and multiple contexts this can result in a session not being invalidated. This can result in an application used on a shared computer being left logged in.",
