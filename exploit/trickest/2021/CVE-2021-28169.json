  "description": " For Eclipse Jetty versions \u003c= 9.4.40, \u003c= 10.0.2, \u003c= 11.0.2, it is possible for requests to the ConcatServlet with a doubly encoded path to access protected resources within the WEB-INF directory. For example a request to `/concat?/%2557EB-INF/web.xml` can retrieve the web.xml file. This can reveal sensitive information regarding the implementation of a web application.",
