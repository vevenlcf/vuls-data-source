  "description": " In EMC ViPR SRM, Storage M\u0026R, VNX M\u0026R, and M\u0026R (Watch4Net) for SAS Solution Packs, the Java Management Extensions (JMX) protocol used to communicate between components in the Alerting and/or Compliance components can be leveraged to create a denial of service (DoS) condition. Attackers with knowledge of JMX agent user credentials could potentially exploit this vulnerability to create arbitrary files on the affected system and create a DoS condition by leveraging inherent JMX protocol capabilities.",
