  "description": " In Apache httpd 2.4.0 to 2.4.29, when mod_session is configured to forward its session data to CGI applications (SessionEnv on, not the default), a remote user may influence their content by using a \"Session\" header. This comes from the \"HTTP_SESSION\" variable name used by mod_session to forward its data to CGIs, since the prefix \"HTTP_\" is also used by the Apache HTTP Server to pass HTTP header fields, per CGI specifications.",
