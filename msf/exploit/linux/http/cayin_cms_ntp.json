  "description": "This module exploits an authenticated RCE in Cayin CMS \u003c= 11.0. The RCE is executed\n          in the system_service.cgi file's ntpIp Parameter. The field is limited in size, so\n          repeated requests are made to achieve a larger payload.\n          Cayin CMS-SE is built for Ubuntu 16.04 (20.04 failed to install correctly), so the\n          environment should be pretty set and not dynamic between targets.\n          Results in root level access.",
