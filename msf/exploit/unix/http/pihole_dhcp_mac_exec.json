  "description": "This exploits a command execution in Pi-Hole \u003c= 4.3.2.  A new DHCP static lease is added\n          with a MAC address which includes an RCE.  Exploitation requires /opt/pihole to be first\n          in the $PATH due to exploitation constraints.  DHCP server is not required to be running.",
