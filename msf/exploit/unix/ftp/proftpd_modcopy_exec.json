  "description": "This module exploits the SITE CPFR/CPTO commands in ProFTPD version 1.3.5.\n          Any unauthenticated client can leverage these commands to copy files from any\n          part of the filesystem to a chosen destination. The copy commands are executed with\n          the rights of the ProFTPD service, which by default runs under the privileges of the\n          'nobody' user. By using /proc/self/cmdline to copy a PHP payload to the website\n          directory, PHP remote code execution is made possible.",
