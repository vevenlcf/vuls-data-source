The issue is triggered due to the jhot.php script\n        not correctly verifying uploaded files. It is possible that the flaw\n        may allow arbitrary PHP code execution by uploading a malicious PHP\n        script resulting in a loss of integrity.\n\n        The vulnerability was reported in Tikiwiki version 1.9.4.",
