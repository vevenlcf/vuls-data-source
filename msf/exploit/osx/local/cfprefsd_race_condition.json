  "description": "This module exploits an arbitrary file write in cfprefsd on macOS \u003c= 10.15.4 in\n          order to run a payload as root. The CFPreferencesSetAppValue function, which is\n          reachable from most unsandboxed processes, can be exploited with a race condition\n          in order to overwrite an arbitrary file as root. By overwriting /etc/pam.d/login\n          a user can then login as root with the `login root` command without a password.",
