  "description": "This exploit targets a weakness in the way the ypupdated RPC\n        application uses the command shell when handling a MAP UPDATE\n        request.  Extra commands may be launched through this command\n        shell, which runs as root on the remote host, by passing\n        commands in the format '|\u003ccommand\u003e'.\n\n        Vulnerable systems include Solaris 2.7, 8, 9, and 10, when\n        ypupdated is started with the '-i' command-line option.",
