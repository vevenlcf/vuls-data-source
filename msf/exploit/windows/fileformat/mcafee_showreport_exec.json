  "description": "This module exploits a vulnerability found in McAfee Security-as-a-Service.\n        The ShowReport() function (located in the myCIOScn.dll ActiveX component) fails\n        to check the FileName argument, and passes it on to a ShellExecuteW() function,\n        therefore allows any malicious attacker to execute any process that's on the\n        local system.  However, if the victim machine is connected to a remote share\n        (or something similar), then it's also possible to execute arbitrary code.\n        Please note that a custom template is required for the payload, because the\n        default Metasploit template is detectable by McAfee -- any Windows binary, such\n        as calc.exe or notepad.exe, should bypass McAfee fine.",
