  "description": "Microsoft Windows allows for the automatic loading of a profiling COM object during\n          the launch of a CLR process based on certain environment variables ostensibly to\n          monitor execution.  In this case, we abuse the profiler by pointing to a payload DLL\n          that will be launched as the profiling thread.  This thread will run at the permission\n          level of the calling process, so an auto-elevating process will launch the DLL with\n          elevated permissions.  In this case, we use gpedit.msc as the auto-elevated CLR\n          process, but others would work, too.",
