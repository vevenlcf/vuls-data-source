  "description": "This module will bypass Windows UAC by utilizing the trusted publisher\n          certificate through process injection. It will spawn a second shell that\n          has the UAC flag turned off by abusing the way \"WinSxS\" works in Windows\n          systems. This module uses the Reflective DLL Injection technique to drop\n          only the DLL payload binary instead of three seperate binaries in the\n          standard technique. However, it requires the correct architecture to be\n          selected, (use x64 for SYSWOW64 systems also).",
