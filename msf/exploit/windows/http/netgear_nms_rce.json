  "description": "Netgear's ProSafe NMS300 is a network management utility that runs on Windows systems.\n        The application has a file upload vulnerability that can be exploited by an\n        unauthenticated remote attacker to execute code as the SYSTEM user.\n        Two servlets are vulnerable, FileUploadController (located at\n        /lib-1.0/external/flash/fileUpload.do) and FileUpload2Controller (located at /fileUpload.do).\n        This module exploits the latter, and has been tested with versions 1.5.0.2, 1.4.0.17 and\n        1.1.0.13.",
