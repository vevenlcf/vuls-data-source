  "description": "This module exploits an arbitrary file upload vulnerability in Oracle Event Processing\n        11.1.1.7.0. The FileUploadServlet component, which requires no authentication, can be\n        abused to upload a malicious file onto an arbitrary location due to a directory traversal\n        flaw, and compromise the server. By default Oracle Event Processing uses a Jetty\n        Application Server without JSP support, which limits the attack to WbemExec. The current\n        WbemExec technique only requires arbitrary write to the file system, but at the moment the\n        module only supports Windows 2003 SP2 or older.",
