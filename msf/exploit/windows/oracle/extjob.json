  "description": "This module exploits the Oracle Job Scheduler to execute arbitrary commands. The Job\n        Scheduler is implemented via the component extjob.exe which listens on a named pipe\n        called \"orcljsex\u003cSID\u003e\" and execute arbitrary commands received over this channel via\n        CreateProcess(). In order to connect to the Named Pipe remotely, SMB access is required.\n        Note that the Job Scheduler is disabled in default installations.",
