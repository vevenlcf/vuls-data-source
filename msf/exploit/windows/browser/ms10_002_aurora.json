  "description": "This module exploits a memory corruption flaw in Internet Explorer. This\n        flaw was found in the wild and was a key component of the \"Operation Aurora\"\n        attacks that lead to the compromise of a number of high profile companies. The\n        exploit code is a direct port of the public sample published to the Wepawet\n        malware analysis site. The technique used by this module is currently identical\n        to the public sample, as such, only Internet Explorer 6 can be reliably exploited.",
