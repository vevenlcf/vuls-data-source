  "description": "This is an exploit against Samsung Security Manager that bypasses the patch in ZDI-15-156 \u0026 ZDI-16-481\n        by exploiting the vulnerability against the client-side. This exploit has been tested successfully using\n        IE, FireFox and Chrome by abusing a GET request XSS to bypass CORS and reach the vulnerable PUT. Finally\n        a traversal is used in the PUT request to upload the code just where we want it and gain RCE as SYSTEM.",
