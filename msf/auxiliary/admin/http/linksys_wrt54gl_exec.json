  "description": "Some Linksys Routers are vulnerable to OS Command injection.\n        You will need credentials to the web interface to access the vulnerable part\n        of the application.\n        Default credentials are always a good starting point. admin/admin or admin\n        and blank password could be a first try.\n        Note: This is a blind OS command injection vulnerability. This means that\n        you will not see any output of your command. Try a ping command to your\n        local system and observe the packets with tcpdump (or equivalent) for a first test.\n\n        Hint: To get a remote shell you could upload a netcat binary and exec it.\n        WARNING: this module will overwrite network and DHCP configuration.",
