  "description": "This module abuses two vulnerabilities in WebNMS Framework Server 5.2 to extract\nall user credentials. The first vulnerability is an unauthenticated file download\nin the FetchFile servlet, which is used to download the file containing the user\ncredentials. The second vulnerability is that the passwords in the file are\nobfuscated with a very weak algorithm which can be easily reversed.\nThis module has been tested with WebNMS Framework Server 5.2 and 5.2 SP1 on\nWindows and Linux.",
