  "description": "This module will download the startup or running configuration\n        from a Cisco IOS device using SNMP and TFTP. A read-write SNMP\n        community is required. The SNMP community scanner module can\n        assist in identifying a read-write community. The target must\n        be able to connect back to the Metasploit system and the use of\n        NAT will cause the TFTP transfer to fail.",
