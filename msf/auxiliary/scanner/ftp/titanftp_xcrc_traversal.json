  "description": "This module exploits a directory traversal vulnerability in the XCRC command\n        implemented in versions of Titan FTP up to and including 8.10.1125. By making\n        sending multiple XCRC command, it is possible to disclose the contents of any\n        file on the drive with a simple CRC \"brute force\" attack.\n\n        Although the daemon runs with SYSTEM privileges, access is limited to files\n        that reside on the same drive as the FTP server's root directory.",
