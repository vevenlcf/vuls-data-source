  "description": "This module exploits an unauthenticated database backup vulnerability in WordPress plugin\n          'Boldgrid-Backup' also known as 'Total Upkeep' version \u003c 1.14.10.\n          First, `env-info.php` is read to get server information.  Next, `restore-info.json` is\n          read to retrieve the last backup file.  That backup is then downloaded, and any sql\n          files will be parsed looking for the wp_users INSERT statement to grab user creds.",
