  "description": "This module exploits a privilege escalation vulnerability found in Microsoft Exchange - CVE-2019-0724\n        Execution of the module will force Exchange to authenticate to an arbitrary URL over HTTP via the Exchange PushSubscription feature.\n        This allows us to relay the NTLM authentication to a Domain Controller and authenticate with the privileges that Exchange is configured.\n        The module is based on the work by @_dirkjan,",
