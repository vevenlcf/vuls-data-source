  "description": "Inject a custom native PE file into the exploited process using a reflective PE loader. The reflective PE\n          loader will execute the pre-mapped PE image starting from the address of entry after performing image base\n          relocation and API address resolution. This module requires a PE file that contains relocation data and a\n          valid (uncorrupted) import table. PE files with CLR(C#/.NET executables), bounded imports, and TLS callbacks\n          are not currently supported. Also PE files which use resource loading might crash.\n        . Connect back to the attacker via a named pipe pivot",
