  "description": "This module will identify systems that have a Domain Admin (delegation) token\n          on them.  The module will first check if sufficient privileges are present for\n          certain actions, and run getprivs for system.  If you elevated privs to system,\n          the SeAssignPrimaryTokenPrivilege will not be assigned, in that case try\n          migrating to another process that is running as system.  If no sufficient\n          privileges are available, the script will not continue.",
