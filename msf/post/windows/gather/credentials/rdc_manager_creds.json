  "description": "This module extracts and decrypts saved Microsoft Remote Desktop\n          Connection Manager (RDCMan) passwords the .RDG files of users.\n          The module will attempt to find the files configured for all users\n          on the target system. Passwords for managed hosts are encrypted by\n          default.  In order for decryption of these passwords to be successful,\n          this module must be executed under the same account as the user which\n          originally encrypted the password.  Passwords stored in plain text will\n          be captured and documented.",
