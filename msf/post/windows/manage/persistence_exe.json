  "description": "This Module will upload an executable to a remote host and make it Persistent.\n          It can be installed as USER, SYSTEM, or SERVICE. USER will start on user login,\n          SYSTEM will start on system boot but requires privs. SERVICE will create a new service\n          which will start the payload. Again requires privs.",
