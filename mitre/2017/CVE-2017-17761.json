  "notes": {
    "description": "An issue was discovered on Ichano AtHome IP Camera devices. The device runs the \"noodles\" binary - a service on port 1300 that allows a remote (LAN) unauthenticated user to run arbitrary commands. This binary requires the \"system\" XML element for specifying the command. For example, a \u003csystem\u003eid\u003c/system\u003e command results in a \u003csystem_ack\u003eok\u003c/system_ack\u003e response.",
