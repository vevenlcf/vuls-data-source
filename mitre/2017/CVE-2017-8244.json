  "notes": {
    "description": "In core_info_read and inst_info_read in all Android releases from CAF using the Linux kernel, variable \"dbg_buf\", \"dbg_buf-\u003ecurr\" and \"dbg_buf-\u003efilled_size\" could be modified by different threads at the same time, but they are not protected with mutex or locks. Buffer overflow is possible on race conditions. \"buffer-\u003ecurr\" itself could also be overwritten, which means that it may point to anywhere of kernel memory (for write).",
