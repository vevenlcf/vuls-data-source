    "description": "Rapid7 Nexpose versions 6.6.93 and earlier are susceptible to an SQL Injection vulnerability, whereby valid search operators are not defined. This lack of validation can allow a logged-in, authenticated attacker to manipulate the \"ANY\" and \"OR\" operators in the SearchCriteria and inject SQL code. This issue was fixed in Rapid7 Nexpose version 6.6.129.",
