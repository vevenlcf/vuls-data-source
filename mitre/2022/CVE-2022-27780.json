    "description": "The curl URL parser wrongly accepts percent-encoded URL separators like '/'when decoding the host name part of a URL, making it a *different* URL usingthe wrong host name when it is later retrieved.For example, a URL like `http://example.com%2F127.0.0.1/`, would be allowed bythe parser and get transposed into `http://example.com/127.0.0.1/`. This flawcan be used to circumvent filters, checks and more.",
