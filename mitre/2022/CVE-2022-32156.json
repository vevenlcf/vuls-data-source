  "notes": {
    "description": "In Splunk Enterprise and Universal Forwarder versions before 9.0, the Splunk command-line interface (CLI) did not validate TLS certificates while connecting to a remote Splunk platform instance by default. Splunk peer communications configured properly with valid certificates were not vulnerable. However, connections from misconfigured nodes without valid certificates did not fail by default. After updating to version 9.0, see Configure TLS host name validation for the Splunk CLI (https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/9.0.0/Security/EnableTLSCertHostnameValidation#Configure_TLS_host_name_validation_for_the_Splunk_CLI) to enable the remediation.",
