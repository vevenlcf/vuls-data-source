  "notes": {
    "description": "Vulnerable versions of the Jupiter (\u003c= 6.10.1) and JupiterX (\u003c= 2.0.6) Themes allow logged-in users, including subscriber-level users, to perform Path Traversal and Local File inclusion. In the JupiterX theme, the jupiterx_cp_load_pane_action AJAX action present in the lib/admin/control-panel/control-panel.php file calls the load_control_panel_pane function. It is possible to use this action to include any local PHP file via the slug parameter. The Jupiter theme has a nearly identical vulnerability which can be exploited via the mka_cp_load_pane_action AJAX action present in the framework/admin/control-panel/logic/functions.php file, which calls the mka_cp_load_pane_action function.",
