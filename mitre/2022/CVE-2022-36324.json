    "description": "A vulnerability has been identified in SCALANCE M-800 / S615 (All versions), SCALANCE W-1700 IEEE 802.11ac family (All versions), SCALANCE W-700 IEEE 802.11ax family (All versions), SCALANCE W-700 IEEE 802.11n family (All versions), SCALANCE XB-200 switch family (All versions), SCALANCE XC-200 switch family (All versions), SCALANCE XF-200BA switch family (All versions), SCALANCE XM-400 Family (All versions), SCALANCE XP-200 switch family (All versions), SCALANCE XR-300WG switch family (All versions), SCALANCE XR-500 Family (All versions). Affected devices do not properly handle the renegotiation of SSL/TLS parameters. This could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to bypass the TCP brute force prevention and lead to a denial of service condition for the duration of the attack.",
