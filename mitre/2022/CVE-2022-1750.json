  "notes": {
    "description": "The Sticky Popup plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the â€˜ popup_title' parameter in versions up to, and including, 1.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with admin level capabilities and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This issue mostly affects sites where unfiltered_html has been disabled for administrators and on multi-site installations where unfiltered_html is disabled for administrators.",
