  "notes": {
    "description": "When DNS over HTTPS is in use, it intentionally filters RFC1918 and related IP ranges from the responses as these do not make sense coming from a DoH resolver. However when an IPv4 address was mapped through IPv6, these addresses were erroneously let through, leading to a potential DNS Rebinding attack. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 83, Firefox ESR \u003c 78.5, and Thunderbird \u003c 78.5.",
