    "description": "Mozilla developers reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox for Android 79. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 80, Firefox ESR \u003c 78.2, Thunderbird \u003c 78.2, and Firefox for Android \u003c 80.",
