    "description": "An issue was discovered in Mbed TLS before 2.25.0 (and before 2.16.9 LTS and before 2.7.18 LTS). The calculations performed by mbedtls_mpi_exp_mod are not limited; thus, supplying overly large parameters could lead to denial of service when generating Diffie-Hellman key pairs.",
