    "description": "MendixSSO \u003c= 2.1.1 contains endpoints that make use of the openid handler, which is suffering from a Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability via the URL path. This is caused by the reflection of user-supplied data without appropriate HTML escaping or output encoding. As a result, a JavaScript payload may be injected into the above endpoint causing it to be executed within the context of the victim's browser.",
