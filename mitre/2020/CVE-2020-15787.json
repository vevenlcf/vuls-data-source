    "description": "A vulnerability has been identified in SIMATIC HMI Unified Comfort Panels (All versions \u003c= V16). Affected devices insufficiently validate authentication attempts as the information given can be truncated to match only a set number of characters versus the whole provided string. This could allow a remote attacker to discover user passwords and obtain access to the Sm@rt Server via a brute-force attack.",
