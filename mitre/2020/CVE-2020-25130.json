  "notes": {
    "description": "An issue was discovered in Observium Professional, Enterprise \u0026 Community 20.8.10631. It is vulnerable to SQL Injection due to the fact that it is possible to inject malicious SQL statements in malformed parameter types. Sending an improper variable type of Array allows a bypass of core SQL Injection sanitization. Authenticated users are able to inject malicious SQL queries. This vulnerability leads to full database leak including ckeys that can be used in the authentication process without knowing the username and cleartext password. This can occur via the ajax/actions.php group_id field.",
