    "description": "A vulnerability has been identified in Capital VSTAR (All versions), Nucleus NET (All versions \u003c V5.2), Nucleus ReadyStart V3 (All versions \u003c V2012.12), Nucleus Source Code (All versions), PLUSCONTROL 1st Gen (All versions). Initial Sequence Numbers (ISNs) for TCP connections are derived from an insufficiently random source. As a result, the ISN of current and future TCP connections could be predictable. An attacker could hijack existing sessions or spoof future ones.",
