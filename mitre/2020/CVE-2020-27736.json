    "description": "A vulnerability has been identified in Nucleus NET (All versions), Nucleus ReadyStart V3 (All versions \u003c V2017.02.3), Nucleus ReadyStart V4 (All versions \u003c V4.1.0), Nucleus Source Code (Versions including affected DNS modules), SIMOTICS CONNECT 400 (All versions \u003c V0.5.0.0). The DNS domain name label parsing functionality does not properly validate the null-terminated name in DNS-responses. The parsing of malformed responses could result in a read past the end of an allocated structure. An attacker with a privileged position in the network could leverage this vulnerability to cause a denial-of-service condition or leak the read memory.",
