    "description": "A vulnerability has been identified in SIMATIC CP 343-1 (incl. SIPLUS variants) (All versions), SIMATIC CP 343-1 Advanced (incl. SIPLUS variants) (All versions), SIMATIC CP 443-1 (incl. SIPLUS variants) (All versions), SIMATIC CP 443-1 Advanced (incl. SIPLUS variants) (All versions), SIMATIC S7-1500 CPU family (incl. related ET200 CPUs and SIPLUS variants) (All versions \u003c V1.7.0), SIMATIC S7-1500 Software Controller (incl. F) (All versions \u003c V1.7.0), SIMATIC S7-300 CPU family (incl. related ET200 CPUs and SIPLUS variants) (All versions \u003c V3.X.16), SIMATIC S7-400 H V6 CPU family (incl. SIPLUS variants) (All versions \u003c V6.0.9), SIMATIC S7-400 PN/DP V6 CPU family (incl. SIPLUS variants) (All versions \u003c V6.0.7), SIMATIC S7-400 PN/DP V7 CPU family (incl. SIPLUS variants) (All versions), SIMATIC S7-410 CPU family (incl. SIPLUS variants) (All versions \u003c V8.1), SIMATIC WinAC RTX (F) 2010 (All versions \u003c SIMATIC WinAC RTX 2010 SP3), SINUMERIK 828D (All versions \u003c V4.7 SP6 HF1), Softnet PROFINET IO for PC-based Windows systems (All versions). Responding to a PROFINET DCP request with a specially crafted PROFINET DCP packet could cause a Denial-of-Service condition of the requesting system. The security vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker located on the same Ethernet segment (OSI Layer 2) as the targeted device. Successful exploitation requires no user interaction or privileges and impacts the availability of core functionality of the affected device. A manual restart is required to recover the system. At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability is known. Siemens provides mitigations to resolve the security issue. PROFIBUS interfaces are not affected.",
