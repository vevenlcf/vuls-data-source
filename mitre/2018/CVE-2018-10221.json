    "description": "An issue was discovered in WUZHI CMS V4.1.0. There is a persistent XSS vulnerability that can steal the administrator cookies via the tag[tag] parameter to the index.php?m=tags\u0026f=index\u0026v=add\u0026\u0026_su=wuzhicms URI. After a website editor (whose privilege is lower than the administrator) logs in, he can add a new TAGS with the XSS payload.",
