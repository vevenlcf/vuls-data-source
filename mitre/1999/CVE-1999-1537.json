    "description": "IIS 3.x and 4.x does not distinguish between pages requiring encryption and those that do not, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (resource exhaustion) via SSL requests to the HTTPS port for normally unencrypted files, which will cause IIS to perform extra work to send the files over SSL.",
