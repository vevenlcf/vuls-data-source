    "description": "The PRNG implementation for the OpenSSL FIPS Object Module 1.1.1 does not perform auto-seeding during the FIPS self-test, which generates random data that is more predictable than expected and makes it easier for attackers to bypass protection mechanisms that rely on the randomness.",
