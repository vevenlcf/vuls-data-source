    "description": "qibosoft 7 allows remote code execution because do/jf.php makes eval calls. The attacker can use the Point Introduction Management feature to supply PHP code to be evaluated. Alternatively, the attacker can access admin/index.php?lfj=jfadmin\u0026action=addjf via CSRF, as demonstrated by a payload in the content parameter.",
