  "description": "Mozilla developers and community members reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 67 and Firefox ESR 60.7. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR \u003c 60.8, Firefox \u003c 68, and Thunderbird \u003c 60.8.",
