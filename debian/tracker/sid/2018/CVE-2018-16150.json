  "id": "CVE-2018-16150",
  "description": "In sig_verify() in x509.c in axTLS version 2.1.3 and before, the PKCS#1 v1.5 signature verification does not reject excess data after the hash value. Consequently, a remote attacker can forge signatures when small public exponents are being used, which could lead to impersonation through fake X.509 certificates. This is a variant of CVE-2006-4340.",
