  "id": "CVE-2019-11743",
  "description": "Navigation events were not fully adhering to the W3C's \"Navigation-Timing Level 2\" draft specification in some instances for the unload event, which restricts access to detailed timing attributes to only be same-origin. This resulted in potential cross-origin information exposure of history through timing side-channel attacks. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 69, Thunderbird \u003c 68.1, Thunderbird \u003c 60.9, Firefox ESR \u003c 60.9, and Firefox ESR \u003c 68.1.",
