  "id": "CVE-2018-12393",
  "description": "A potential vulnerability was found in 32-bit builds where an integer overflow during the conversion of scripts to an internal UTF-16 representation could result in allocating a buffer too small for the conversion. This leads to a possible out-of-bounds write. *Note: 64-bit builds are not vulnerable to this issue.*. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 63, Firefox ESR \u003c 60.3, and Thunderbird \u003c 60.3.",
