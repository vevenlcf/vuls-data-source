  "description": "Mozilla developers and community members reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 64 and Firefox ESR 60.4. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird \u003c 60.5, Firefox ESR \u003c 60.5, and Firefox \u003c 65.",
