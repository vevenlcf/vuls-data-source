  "id": "CVE-2021-3713",
  "description": "An out-of-bounds write flaw was found in the UAS (USB Attached SCSI) device emulation of QEMU in versions prior to 6.2.0-rc0. The device uses the guest supplied stream number unchecked, which can lead to out-of-bounds access to the UASDevice-\u003edata3 and UASDevice-\u003estatus3 fields. A malicious guest user could use this flaw to crash QEMU or potentially achieve code execution with the privileges of the QEMU process on the host.",
