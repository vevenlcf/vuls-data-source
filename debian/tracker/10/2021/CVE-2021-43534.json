  "description": "Mozilla developers and community members reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 93 and Firefox ESR 91.2. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 94, Thunderbird \u003c 91.3, and Firefox ESR \u003c 91.3.",
