  "description": "PostSRSd before 1.11 allows a denial of service (subprocess hang) if Postfix sends certain long data fields such as multiple concatenated email addresses. NOTE: the PostSRSd maintainer acknowledges \"theoretically, this error should never occur ... I'm not sure if there's a reliable way to trigger this condition by an external attacker, but it is a security bug in PostSRSd nevertheless.\"",
