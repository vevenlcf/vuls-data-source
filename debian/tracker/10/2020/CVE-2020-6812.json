  "id": "CVE-2020-6812",
  "description": "The first time AirPods are connected to an iPhone, they become named after the user's name by default (e.g. Jane Doe's AirPods.) Websites with camera or microphone permission are able to enumerate device names, disclosing the user's name. To resolve this issue, Firefox added a special case that renames devices containing the substring 'AirPods' to simply 'AirPods'. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird \u003c 68.6, Firefox \u003c 74, Firefox \u003c ESR68.6, and Firefox ESR \u003c 68.6.",
