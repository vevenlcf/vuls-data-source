  "title": "CVE-2017-6014 wireshark",
  "description": "In Wireshark 2.2.4 and earlier, a crafted or malformed STANAG 4607 capture file will cause an infinite loop and memory exhaustion. If the packet size field in a packet header is null, the offset to read from will not advance, causing continuous attempts to read the same zero length packet. This will quickly exhaust all system memory.",
