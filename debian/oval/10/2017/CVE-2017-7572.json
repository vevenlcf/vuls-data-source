  "title": "CVE-2017-7572 backintime",
  "description": "The _checkPolkitPrivilege function in serviceHelper.py in Back In Time (aka backintime) 1.1.18 and earlier uses a deprecated polkit authorization method (unix-process) that is subject to a race condition (time of check, time of use). With this authorization method, the owner of a process requesting a polkit operation is checked by polkitd via /proc/\u003cpid\u003e/status, by which time the requesting process may have been replaced by a different process with the same PID that has different privileges then the original requester.",
