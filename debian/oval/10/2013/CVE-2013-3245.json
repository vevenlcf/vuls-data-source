  "title": "CVE-2013-3245 vlc",
  "description": "** DISPUTED ** plugins/demux/libmkv_plugin.dll in VideoLAN VLC Media Player 2.0.7, and possibly other versions, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted MKV file, possibly involving an integer overflow and out-of-bounds read or heap-based buffer overflow, or an uncaught exception.  NOTE: the vendor disputes the severity and claimed vulnerability type of this issue, stating \"This PoC crashes VLC, indeed, but does nothing more... this is not an integer overflow error, but an uncaught exception and I doubt that it is exploitable. This uncaught exception makes VLC abort, not execute random code, on my Linux 64bits machine.\" A PoC posted by the original researcher shows signs of an attacker-controlled out-of-bounds read, but the affected instruction does not involve a register that directly influences control flow.",
