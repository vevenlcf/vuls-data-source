  "description": "An issue found in linux-kernel that leads to a race condition in rose_connect(). The rose driver uses rose_neigh-\u003euse to represent how many objects are using the rose_neigh. When a user wants to delete a rose_route via rose_ioctl(), the rose driver calls rose_del_node() and removes neighbours only if their “count” and “use” are zero.",
