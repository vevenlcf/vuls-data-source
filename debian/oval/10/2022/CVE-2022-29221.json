  "moreinfo": "\nSeveral security vulnerabilities have been discovered in smarty3, the compiling PHP template engine. Template authors are able to run restricted static php methods or even arbitrary PHP code by crafting a malicious math string or by choosing an invalid {block} or {include} file name. If a math string was passed through as user provided data to the math function, remote users were able to run arbitrary PHP code as well.",
