XSS can occur in configurations that allow a JavaScript payload in a username. After account creation, when it sets the page title to \"Welcome\" followed by the username, the username is not escaped: SpecialCreateAccount::successfulAction() calls ::showSuccessPage() with a message as second parameter, and OutputPage::setPageTitle() uses text().",
