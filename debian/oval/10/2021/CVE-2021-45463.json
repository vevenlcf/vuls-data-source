  "title": "CVE-2021-45463 gegl",
  "description": "load_cache in GEGL before 0.4.34 allows shell expansion when a pathname in a constructed command line is not escaped or filtered. This is caused by use of the system library function for execution of the ImageMagick convert fallback in magick-load. NOTE: GEGL releases before 0.4.34 are used in GIMP releases before 2.10.30; however, this does not imply that GIMP builds enable the vulnerable feature.",
