  "title": "CVE-2021-4207 qemu",
  "description": "A flaw was found in the QXL display device emulation in QEMU. A double fetch of guest controlled values `cursor-\u003eheader.width` and `cursor-\u003eheader.height` can lead to the allocation of a small cursor object followed by a subsequent heap-based buffer overflow. A malicious privileged guest user could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process on the host or potentially execute arbitrary code within the context of the QEMU process.",
