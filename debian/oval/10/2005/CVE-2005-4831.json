  "description": "viewcvs in ViewCVS 0.9.2 allows remote attackers to set the Content-Type header to arbitrary values via the content-type parameter, which can be leveraged for cross-site scripting (XSS) and other attacks, as demonstrated using (1) \"text/html\", or (2) \"image/jpeg\" with an image that is rendered as HTML by Internet Explorer, a different vulnerability than CVE-2004-1062.  NOTE: it was later reported that 0.9.4 is also affected.",
