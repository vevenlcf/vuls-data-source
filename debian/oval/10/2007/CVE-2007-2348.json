  "description": "mirror --script in lftp before 3.5.9 does not properly quote shell metacharacters, which might allow remote user-assisted attackers to execute shell commands via a malicious script.  NOTE: it is not clear whether this issue crosses security boundaries, since the script already supports commands such as \"get\" which could overwrite executable files.",
