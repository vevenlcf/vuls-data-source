An attacker who submits a crafted file that is processed by ImageMagick could trigger undefined behavior in the form of math division by zero. This would most likely lead to an impact to application availability, but could potentially cause other problems related to undefined behavior. This flaw affects ImageMagick versions prior to 7.0.8-68.",
