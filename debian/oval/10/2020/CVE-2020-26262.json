  "description": "security update",
  "moreinfo": "A flaw was discovered in coturn, a TURN and STUN server for VoIP. By default coturn does not allow peers on the loopback addresses (127.x.x.x and ::1). A remote attacker can bypass the protection via a specially crafted request using a peer address of \u003cq\u003e0.0.0.0\u003c/q\u003e and trick coturn in relaying to the loopback interface. If listening on IPv6 the loopback interface can also be reached by using either [::1] or [::] as the address.",
