  "description": "The DGifDecompressLine function in dgif_lib.c in GIFLIB (possibly version 3.0.x), as later shipped in cgif.c in sam2p 0.49.4, has a heap-based buffer overflow because a certain \"Private-\u003eRunningCode - 2\" array index is not checked. This will lead to a denial of service or possibly unspecified other impact.",
