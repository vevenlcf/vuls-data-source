  "title": "CVE-2016-9962 runc",
  "description": "RunC allowed additional container processes via 'runc exec' to be ptraced by the pid 1 of the container.  This allows the main processes of the container, if running as root, to gain access to file-descriptors of these new processes during the initialization and can lead to container escapes or modification of runC state before the process is fully placed inside the container.",
