Due to a misconfiguration during the setup of the DBus, any unprivileged user could monitor and send method calls to the ibus bus of another user, if able to discover the UNIX socket used by another user connected on a graphical environment. The attacker can take advantage of this flaw to intercept keystrokes of the victim user or modify input related configurations through DBus method calls.",
