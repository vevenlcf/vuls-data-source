  "title": "CVE-2019-6245 svgpp",
  "description": "An issue was discovered in Anti-Grain Geometry (AGG) 2.4 as used in SVG++ (aka svgpp) 1.2.3. In the function agg::cell_aa::not_equal, dx is assigned to (x2 - x1). If dx \u003e= dx_limit, which is (16384 \u003c\u003c poly_subpixel_shift), this function will call itself recursively. There can be a situation where (x2 - x1) is always bigger than dx_limit during the recursion, leading to continual stack consumption.",
