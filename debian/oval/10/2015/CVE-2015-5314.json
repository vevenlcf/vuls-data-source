  "description": "The eap_pwd_process function in eap_server/eap_server_pwd.c in hostapd 2.x before 2.6 does not validate that the reassembly buffer is large enough for the final fragment when used with (1) an internal EAP server or (2) a RADIUS server and EAP-pwd is enabled in a runtime configuration, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (process termination) via a large final fragment in an EAP-pwd message.",
