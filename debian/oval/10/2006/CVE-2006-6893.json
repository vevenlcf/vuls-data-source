  "title": "CVE-2006-6893 tor",
  "description": "Tor allows remote attackers to discover the IP address of a hidden service by accessing this service at a high rate, thereby changing the server's CPU temperature and consequently changing the pattern of time values visible through (1) ICMP timestamps, (2) TCP sequence numbers, and (3) TCP timestamps, a different vulnerability than CVE-2006-0414. NOTE: it could be argued that this is a laws-of-physics vulnerability that is a fundamental design limitation of certain hardware implementations, so perhaps this issue should not be included in CVE.",
