  "moreinfo": "\nChristian Reitter discovered that libu2f-host, a library implementing the host-side of the U2F protocol, failed to properly check for a buffer overflow. This would allow an attacker with a custom made malicious USB device masquerading as a security key, and physical access to a computer where PAM U2F or an application with libu2f-host integrated, to potentially execute arbitrary code on that computer.",
