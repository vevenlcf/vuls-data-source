  "description": "security update",
  "moreinfo": "\nChristian BoxdĂśrfer discovered a vulnerability in the handling of FreeDesktop.org .desktop files in Nautilus, a file manager for the GNOME desktop environment. An attacker can craft a .desktop file intended to run malicious commands but displayed as a innocuous document file in Nautilus. An user would then trust it and open the file, and Nautilus would in turn execute the malicious content. Nautilus protection of only trusting .desktop files with executable permission can be bypassed by shipping the .desktop file inside a tarball.",
