  "moreinfo": "\nGabriel Corona discovered that xdg-utils, a set of tools for desktop environment integration, is vulnerable to argument injection attacks. If the environment variable BROWSER in the victim host has a \"%s\" and the victim opens a link crafted by an attacker with xdg-open, the malicious party could manipulate the parameters used by the browser when opened. This manipulation could set, for example, a proxy to which the network traffic could be intercepted for that particular execution.",
