  "moreinfo": "\nIt was discovered that a maliciously crafted query can cause ISC's BIND DNS server (named) to crash if both Response Policy Zones (RPZ) and DNS64 (a bridge between IPv4 and IPv6 networks) are enabled.  It is uncommon for both of these options to be used in combination, so very few systems will be affected by this problem in practice.",
