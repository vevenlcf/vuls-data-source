  "moreinfo": "\nAn information disclosure flaw due to incorrect JkMount/JkUnmount directives processing was found in the Apache 2 module mod_jk to forward requests from the Apache web server to Tomcat. A JkUnmount rule for a subtree of a previous JkMount rule could be ignored. This could allow a remote attacker to potentially access a private artifact in a tree that would otherwise not be accessible to them.",
