  "description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel 5.5 through 5.7.9, as used in Xen through 4.13.x for x86 PV guests. An attacker may be granted the I/O port permissions of an unrelated task. This occurs because tss_invalidate_io_bitmap mishandling causes a loss of synchronization between the I/O bitmaps of TSS and Xen, aka CID-cadfad870154.",
