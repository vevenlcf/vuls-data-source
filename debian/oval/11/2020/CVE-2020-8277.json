  "description": "A Node.js application that allows an attacker to trigger a DNS request for a host of their choice could trigger a Denial of Service in versions \u003c 15.2.1, \u003c 14.15.1, and \u003c 12.19.1 by getting the application to resolve a DNS record with a larger number of responses. This is fixed in 15.2.1, 14.15.1, and 12.19.1.",
