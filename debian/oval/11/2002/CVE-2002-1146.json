  "description": "The BIND 4 and BIND 8.2.x stub resolver libraries, and other libraries such as glibc 2.2.5 and earlier, libc, and libresolv, use the maximum buffer size instead of the actual size when processing a DNS response, which causes the stub resolvers to read past the actual boundary (\"read buffer overflow\"), allowing remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash).",
