  "title": "CVE-2016-9604 linux",
  "description": "It was discovered in the Linux kernel before 4.11-rc8 that root can gain direct access to an internal keyring, such as '.dns_resolver' in RHEL-7 or '.builtin_trusted_keys' upstream, by joining it as its session keyring. This allows root to bypass module signature verification by adding a new public key of its own devising to the keyring.",
