  "description": "Use-after-free in the usbtv_probe function in drivers/media/usb/usbtv/usbtv-core.c in the Linux kernel through 4.14.10 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact by triggering failure of audio registration, because a kfree of the usbtv data structure occurs during a usbtv_video_free call, but the usbtv_video_fail label's code attempts to both access and free this data structure.",
