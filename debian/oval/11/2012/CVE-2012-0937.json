  "description": "** DISPUTED ** wp-admin/setup-config.php in the installation component in WordPress 3.3.1 and earlier does not limit the number of MySQL queries sent to external MySQL database servers, which allows remote attackers to use WordPress as a proxy for brute-force attacks or denial of service attacks via the dbhost parameter, a different vulnerability than CVE-2011-4898.  NOTE: the vendor disputes the significance of this issue because an incomplete WordPress installation might be present on the network for only a short time.",
