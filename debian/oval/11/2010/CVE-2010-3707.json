  "description": "plugins/acl/acl-backend-vfile.c in Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.15 and 2.0.x before 2.0.5 interprets an ACL entry as a directive to add to the permissions granted by another ACL entry, instead of a directive to replace the permissions granted by another ACL entry, in certain circumstances involving more specific entries that occur after less specific entries, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions via a request to read or modify a mailbox.",
