  "title": "CVE-2022-23639 rust-crossbeam-utils",
  "description": "crossbeam-utils provides atomics, synchronization primitives, scoped threads, and other utilities for concurrent programming in Rust. crossbeam-utils prior to version 0.8.7 incorrectly assumed that the alignment of `{i,u}64` was always the same as `Atomic{I,U}64`. However, the alignment of `{i,u}64` on a 32-bit target can be smaller than `Atomic{I,U}64`. This can cause unaligned memory accesses and data race. Crates using `fetch_*` methods with `AtomicCell\u003c{i,u}64\u003e` are affected by this issue. 32-bit targets without `Atomic{I,U}64` and 64-bit targets are not affected by this issue. This has been fixed in crossbeam-utils 0.8.7. There are currently no known workarounds.",
