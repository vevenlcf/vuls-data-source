  "moreinfo": "\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in Minetest, a sandbox video game and game creation system. These issues may allow attackers to manipulate game mods and grant them an unfair advantage over other players. These flaws could also be abused for a denial of service attack against a Minetest server or if user input is passed directly to minetest.deserialize without serializing it first, then a malicious user could run Lua code in the server environment.",
