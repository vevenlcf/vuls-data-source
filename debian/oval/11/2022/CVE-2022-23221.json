  "description": "security update",
  "moreinfo": "\nSecurity researchers of JFrog Security and Ismail Aydemir discovered two remote code execution vulnerabilities in the H2 Java SQL database engine which can be exploited through various attack vectors, most notably through the H2 Console and by loading custom classes from remote servers through JNDI. The H2 console is a developer tool and not required by any reverse-dependency in Debian. It has been disabled in (old)stable releases. Database developers are advised to use at least version 2.1.210-1, currently available in Debian unstable.",
