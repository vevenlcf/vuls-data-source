  "moreinfo": "Several vulnerabilities were discovered in HAProxy, a fast and reliable load balancing reverse proxy, which can result in HTTP request smuggling. By carefully crafting HTTP/2 requests, it is possible to smuggle another HTTP request to the backend selected by the HTTP/2 request. With certain configurations, it allows an attacker to send an HTTP request to a backend, circumventing the backend selection logic.",
