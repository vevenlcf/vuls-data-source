  "description": "An issue was discovered in MediaWiki before 1.31.12 and 1.32.x through 1.35.x before 1.35.2. Users can bypass intended restrictions on deleting pages in certain \"fast double move\" situations. MovePage::isValidMoveTarget() uses FOR UPDATE, but it's only called if Title::getArticleID() returns non-zero with no special flags. Next, MovePage::moveToInternal() will delete the page if getArticleID(READ_LATEST) is non-zero. Therefore, if the page is missing in the replica DB, isValidMove() will return true, and then moveToInternal() will unconditionally delete the page if it can be found in the master.",
