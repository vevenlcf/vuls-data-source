  "description": "When loading the shared library that provides the OTR protocol implementation, Thunderbird will initially attempt to open it using a filename that isn't distributed by Thunderbird. If a computer has already been infected with a malicious library of the alternative filename, and the malicious library has been copied to a directory that is contained in the search path for executable libraries, then Thunderbird will load the incorrect library.
