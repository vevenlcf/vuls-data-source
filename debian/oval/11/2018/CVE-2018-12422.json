  "description": "** DISPUTED ** addressbook/backends/ldap/e-book-backend-ldap.c in Evolution-Data-Server in GNOME Evolution through 3.29.2 might allow attackers to trigger a Buffer Overflow via a long query that is processed by the strcat function. NOTE: the software maintainer disputes this because \"the code had computed the required string length first, and then allocated a large-enough buffer on the heap.\"",
