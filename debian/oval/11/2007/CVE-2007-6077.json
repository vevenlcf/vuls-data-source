  "title": "CVE-2007-6077 rails",
  "description": "The session fixation protection mechanism in cgi_process.rb in Rails 1.2.4, as used in Ruby on Rails, removes the :cookie_only attribute from the DEFAULT_SESSION_OPTIONS constant, which effectively causes cookie_only to be applied only to the first instantiation of CgiRequest, which allows remote attackers to conduct session fixation attacks.  NOTE: this is due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2007-5380.",
