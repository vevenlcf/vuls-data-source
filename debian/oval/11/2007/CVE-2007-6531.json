  "description": "Stack-based buffer overflow in the Panel (xfce4-panel) component in Xfce before 4.4.2 might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via Launcher tooltips.  NOTE: a second buffer overflow (over-read) in the xfce_mkdirhier function was also reported, but it might not be exploitable for a crash or code execution, so it is not a vulnerability.",
