  "title": "CVE-2007-3528 dar",
  "description": "The blowfish mode in DAR before 2.3.4 uses weak Blowfish-CBC cryptography by (1) discarding random bits by the blowfish::make_ivec function in libdar/crypto.cpp that results in predictable and repeating IV values, and (2) direct use of a password for keying, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to decrypt files.",
