  "description": "The scm_check_creds function in net/core/scm.c in the Linux kernel before 3.8.6 does not properly enforce capability requirements for controlling the PID value associated with a UNIX domain socket, which allows local users to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging the time interval during which a user namespace has been created but a PID namespace has not been created.",
