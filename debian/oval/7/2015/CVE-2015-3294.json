  "description": "security update",
  "moreinfo": "\nNick Sampanis discovered that dnsmasq, a small caching DNS proxy and DHCP/TFTP server, did not properly check the return value of the setup_reply() function called during a TCP connection, which is used then as a size argument in a function which writes data on the client's connection. A remote attacker could exploit this issue via a specially crafted DNS request to cause dnsmasq to crash, or potentially to obtain sensitive information from process memory.",
