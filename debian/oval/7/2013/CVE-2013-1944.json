  "moreinfo": "\nYamada Yasuharu discovered that cURL, an URL transfer library, is vulnerable to expose potentially sensitive information when doing requests across domains with matching tails. Due to a bug in the tailmatch function when matching domain names, it was possible that cookies set for a domain \u003cq\u003eample.com\u003c/q\u003e could accidentally also be sent by libcurl when communicating with \u003cq\u003eexample.com\u003c/q\u003e.",
