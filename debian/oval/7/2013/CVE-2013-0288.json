  "moreinfo": "\nGarth Mollett discovered that a file descriptor overflow issue in the use of FD_SET() in nss-pam-ldapd, which provides NSS and PAM modules for using LDAP as a naming service, can lead to a stack-based buffer overflow. An attacker could, under some circumstances, use this flaw to cause a process that has the NSS or PAM module loaded to crash or potentially execute arbitrary code.",
