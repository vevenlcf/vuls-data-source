  "description": "lack of tainted flag propagation",
  "moreinfo": "\nMark Martinec discovered that Perl incorrectly clears the tainted flag on values returned by case conversion functions such as \u003cq\u003elc\u003c/q\u003e.  This may expose preexisting vulnerabilities in applications which use these functions while processing untrusted input.  No such applications are known at this stage.  Such applications will cease to work when this security update is applied because taint checks are designed to prevent such unsafe use of untrusted input data.",
