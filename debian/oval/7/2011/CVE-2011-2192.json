  "description": "improper delegation of client credentials",
  "moreinfo": "\nRichard Silverman discovered that when doing GSSAPI authentication, libcurl unconditionally performs credential delegation. This hands the server a copy of the client's security credentials, allowing the server to impersonate the client to any other using the same GSSAPI mechanism. This is obviously a very sensitive operation, which should only be done when the user explicitly so directs.",
