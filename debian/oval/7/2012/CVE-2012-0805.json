  "description": "missing input sanitization",
  "moreinfo": "\nIt was discovered that SQLAlchemy, an SQL toolkit and object relational mapper for Python, is not sanitizing input passed to the limit/offset keywords to select() as well as the value passed to select.limit()/offset(). This allows an attacker to perform SQL injection attacks against applications using SQLAlchemy that do not implement their own filtering.",
