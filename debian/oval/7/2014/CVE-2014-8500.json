  "moreinfo": "\nIt was discovered that BIND, a DNS server, is prone to a denial of  service vulnerability.\nBy making use of maliciously-constructed zones or a rogue server, an  attacker can exploit an oversight in the code BIND 9 uses to follow  delegations in the Domain Name Service, causing BIND to issue unlimited  queries in an attempt to follow the delegation.\nThis can lead to resource exhaustion and denial of service  (up to and including termination of the named server process.)",
