  "moreinfo": "\nTobias Stoeckmann discovered that the libXpm library contained two integer overflow flaws, leading to a heap out-of-bounds write, while parsing XPM extensions in a file. An attacker can provide a specially crafted XPM file that, when processed by an application using the libXpm library, would cause a denial-of-service against the application, or potentially, the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.",
