  "moreinfo": "\nJulien Bernard discovered that libndp, a library for the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Protocol, does not properly perform input and origin checks during the reception of a NDP message. An attacker in a non-local network could use this flaw to advertise a node as a router, and cause a denial of service attack, or act as a man-in-the-middle.",
