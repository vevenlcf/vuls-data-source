  "moreinfo": "\nEric Sesterhenn, from X41 D-Sec GmbH, discovered several vulnerabilities in tnef, a tool used to unpack MIME attachments of type \u003cq\u003eapplication/ms-tnef\u003c/q\u003e. Multiple heap overflows, type confusions and out of bound reads and writes could be exploited by tricking a user into opening a malicious attachment. This would result in denial of service via application crash, or potential arbitrary code execution.",
