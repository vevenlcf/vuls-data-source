  "moreinfo": "\nIt was discovered that the Dovecot email server is vulnerable to a denial of service attack. When the \u003cq\u003edict\u003c/q\u003e passdb and userdb are used for user authentication, the username sent by the IMAP/POP3 client is sent through var_expand() to perform %variable expansion. Sending specially crafted %variable fields could result in excessive memory usage causing the process to crash (and restart).",
