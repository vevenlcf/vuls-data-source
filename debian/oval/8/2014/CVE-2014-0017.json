  "moreinfo": "\nIt was discovered that libssh, a tiny C SSH library, did not reset the state of the PRNG after accepting a connection. A server mode application that forks itself to handle incoming connections could see its children sharing the same PRNG state, resulting in a cryptographic weakness and possibly the recovery of the private key.",
