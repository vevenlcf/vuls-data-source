  "description": "security update",
  "moreinfo": "\nJohan Olofsson discovered an authentication bypass vulnerability in Stunnel, a program designed to work as an universal SSL tunnel for network daemons. When Stunnel in server mode is used with the redirect option and certificate-based authentication is enabled with \u003cq\u003everify = 2\u003c/q\u003e or higher, then only the initial connection is redirected to the hosts specified with \u003cq\u003eredirect\u003c/q\u003e. This allows a remote attacker to bypass authentication.",
