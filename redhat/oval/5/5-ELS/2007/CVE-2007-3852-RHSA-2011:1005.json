  "title": "RHSA-2011:1005: sysstat security, bug fix, and enhancement update (Low)",
  "description": "The sysstat package contains a set of utilities which enable system\nmonitoring of disks, network, and other I/O activity.\n\nIt was found that the sysstat initscript created a temporary file in an\ninsecure way. A local attacker could use this flaw to create arbitrary\nfiles via a symbolic link attack. (CVE-2007-3852)\n\nThis update fixes the following bugs:\n\n* On systems under heavy load, the sadc utility would sometimes output the\nfollowing error message if a write() call was unable to write all of the\nrequested input:\n\n\"Cannot write data to system activity file: Success.\"\n\nIn this updated package, the sadc utility tries to write the remaining\ninput, resolving this issue. (BZ#454617)\n\n* On the Itanium architecture, the \"sar -I\" command provided incorrect\ninformation about the interrupt statistics of the system. With this update,\nthe \"sar -I\" command has been disabled for this architecture, preventing\nthis bug. (BZ#468340)\n\n* Previously, the \"iostat -n\" command used invalid data to create\nstatistics for read and write operations. With this update, the data source\nfor these statistics has been fixed, and the iostat utility now returns\ncorrect information. (BZ#484439)\n\n* The \"sar -d\" command used to output invalid data about block devices.\nWith this update, the sar utility recognizes disk registration and disk\noverflow statistics properly, and only correct and relevant data is now\ndisplayed. (BZ#517490)\n\n* Previously, the sar utility set the maximum number of days to be logged\nin one month too high. Consequently, data from a month was appended to\ndata from the preceding month. With this update, the maximum number of days\nhas been set to 25, and data from a month now correctly replaces data from\nthe preceding month. (BZ#578929)\n\n* In previous versions of the iostat utility, the number of NFS mount\npoints was hard-coded. Consequently, various issues occurred while iostat\nwas running and NFS mount points were mounted or unmounted; certain values\nin iostat reports overflowed and some mount points were not reported at\nall. With this update, iostat properly recognizes when an NFS mount point\nmounts or unmounts, fixing these issues. (BZ#675058, BZ#706095, BZ#694767)\n\n* When a device name was longer than 13 characters, the iostat utility\nprinted a redundant new line character, making its output less readable.\nThis bug has been fixed and now, no extra characters are printed if a long\ndevice name occurs in iostat output. (BZ#604637)\n\n* Previously, if kernel interrupt counters overflowed, the sar utility\nprovided confusing output. This bug has been fixed and the sum of\ninterrupts is now reported correctly. (BZ#622557)\n\n* When some processors were disabled on a multi-processor system, the sar\nutility sometimes failed to provide information about the CPU activity.\nWith this update, the uptime of a single processor is used to compute the\nstatistics, rather than the total uptime of all processors, and this bug no\nlonger occurs. (BZ#630559)\n\n* Previously, the mpstat utility wrongly interpreted data about processors\nin the system. Consequently, it reported a processor that did not exist.\nThis bug has been fixed and non-existent CPUs are no longer reported by\nmpstat. (BZ#579409)\n\n* Previously, there was no easy way to enable the collection of statistics\nabout disks and interrupts. Now, the SADC_OPTIONS variable can be used to\nset parameters for the sadc utility, fixing this bug. (BZ#598794)\n\n* The read_uptime() function failed to close its open file upon exit. A\npatch has been provided to fix this bug. (BZ#696672)\n\nThis update also adds the following enhancement:\n\n* With this update, the cifsiostat utility has been added to the sysstat\npackage to provide CIFS (Common Internet File System) mount point I/O\nstatistics. (BZ#591530)\n\nAll sysstat users are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which\ncontains backported patches to correct these issues and add this\nenhancement.",
