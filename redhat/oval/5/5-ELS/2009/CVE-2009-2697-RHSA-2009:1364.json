  "title": "RHSA-2009:1364: gdm security and bug fix update (Low)",
  "description": "The GNOME Display Manager (GDM) is a configurable re-implementation of XDM,\nthe X Display Manager. GDM allows you to log in to your system with the X\nWindow System running, and supports running several different X sessions on\nyour local machine at the same time.\n\nA flaw was found in the way the gdm package was built. The gdm package was\nmissing TCP wrappers support, which could result in an administrator\nbelieving they had access restrictions enabled when they did not.\n(CVE-2009-2697)\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* the GDM Reference Manual is now included with the gdm packages. The\ngdm-docs package installs this document in HTML format in\n\"/usr/share/doc/\". (BZ#196054)\n\n* GDM appeared in English on systems using Telugu (te_IN). With this\nupdate, GDM has been localized in te_IN. (BZ#226931)\n\n* the Ctrl+Alt+Backspace sequence resets the X server when in runlevel 5.\nIn previous releases, however, repeated use of this sequence prevented GDM\nfrom starting the X server as part of the reset process. This was because\nGDM sometimes did not notice the X server shutdown properly and would\nsubsequently fail to complete the reset process. This update contains an\nadded check to explicitly notify GDM whenever the X server is terminated,\nensuring that resets are executed reliably. (BZ#441971)\n\n* the \"gdm\" user is now part of the \"audio\" group by default. This enables\naudio support at the login screen. (BZ#458331)\n\n* the gui/modules/dwellmouselistener.c source code contained incorrect\nXInput code that prevented tablet devices from working properly. This\nupdate removes the errant code, ensuring that tablet devices work as\nexpected. (BZ#473262)\n\n* a bug in the XOpenDevice() function prevented the X server from starting\nwhenever a device defined in \"/etc/X11/xorg.conf\" was not actually plugged\nin. This update wraps XOpenDevice() in the gdk_error_trap_pop() and\ngdk_error_trap_push() functions, which resolves this bug. This ensures that\nthe X server can start properly even when devices defined in\n\"/etc/X11/xorg.conf\" are not plugged in. (BZ#474588)\n\nAll users should upgrade to these updated packages, which resolve these\nissues. GDM must be restarted for this update to take effect. Rebooting\nachieves this, but changing the runlevel from 5 to 3 and back to 5 also\nrestarts GDM.",
