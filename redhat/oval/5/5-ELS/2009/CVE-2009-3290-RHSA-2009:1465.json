  "title": "RHSA-2009:1465: kvm security and bug fix update (Important)",
  "description": "KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for\nLinux on AMD64 and Intel 64 systems. KVM is a Linux kernel module built for\nthe standard Red Hat Enterprise Linux kernel.\n\nThe kvm_emulate_hypercall() implementation was missing a check for the\nCurrent Privilege Level (CPL). A local, unprivileged user in a virtual\nmachine could use this flaw to cause a local denial of service or escalate\ntheir privileges within that virtual machine. (CVE-2009-3290)\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* non-maskable interrupts (NMI) were not supported on systems with AMD\nprocessors. As a consequence, Windows Server 2008 R2 guests running with\nmore than one virtual CPU assigned on systems with AMD processors would\nhang at the Windows shut down screen when a restart was attempted. This\nupdate adds support for NMI filtering on systems with AMD processors,\nallowing clean restarts of Windows Server 2008 R2 guests running with\nmultiple virtual CPUs. (BZ#520694)\n\n* significant performance issues for guests running 64-bit editions of\nWindows. This update improves performance for guests running 64-bit\neditions of Windows. (BZ#521793)\n\n* Windows guests may have experienced time drift. (BZ#521794)\n\n* removing the Red Hat VirtIO Ethernet Adapter from a guest running Windows\nServer 2008 R2 caused KVM to crash. With this update, device removal should\nnot cause this issue. (BZ#524557)\n\nAll KVM users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported patches to resolve these issues. Note: The procedure in the\nSolution section must be performed before this update takes effect.",
