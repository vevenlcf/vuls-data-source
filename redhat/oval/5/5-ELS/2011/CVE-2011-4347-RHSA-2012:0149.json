  "title": "RHSA-2012:0149: kvm security and bug fix update (Moderate)",
  "description": "KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for\nLinux on AMD64 and Intel 64 systems. KVM is a Linux kernel module built for\nthe standard Red Hat Enterprise Linux kernel.\n\nIt was found that the kvm_vm_ioctl_assign_device() function in the KVM\nsubsystem of a Linux kernel did not check if the user requesting device\nassignment was privileged or not. A member of the kvm group on the host\ncould assign unused PCI devices, or even devices that were in use and\nwhose resources were not properly claimed by the respective drivers, which\ncould result in the host crashing. (CVE-2011-4347)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Sasha Levin for reporting this issue.\n\nThese updated kvm packages include several bug fixes. Space precludes\ndocumenting all of these changes in this advisory. Users are directed to\nthe Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.8 Technical Notes, linked to in the\nReferences, for information on the most significant of these changes.\n\nAll KVM users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported patches to correct these issues. Note: The procedure in the\nSolution section must be performed before this update will take effect.",
