  "title": "RHSA-2009:0382: libvirt security update (Moderate)",
  "description": "libvirt is a C API for managing and interacting with the virtualization\ncapabilities of Linux and other operating systems. libvirt also provides\ntools for remotely managing virtualized systems.\n\nThe libvirtd daemon was discovered to not properly check user connection\npermissions before performing certain privileged actions, such as\nrequesting migration of an unprivileged guest domain to another system. A\nlocal user able to establish a read-only connection to libvirtd could use\nthis flaw to perform actions that should be restricted to read-write\nconnections. (CVE-2008-5086)\n\nlibvirt_proxy, a setuid helper application allowing non-privileged users to\ncommunicate with the hypervisor, was discovered to not properly validate\nuser requests. Local users could use this flaw to cause a stack-based\nbuffer overflow in libvirt_proxy, possibly allowing them to run arbitrary\ncode with root privileges. (CVE-2009-0036)\n\nAll users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported patches which resolve these issues. After installing the update,\nlibvirtd must be restarted manually (for example, by issuing a \"service\nlibvirtd restart\" command), and guest systems rebooted, for this change to\ntake effect.",
