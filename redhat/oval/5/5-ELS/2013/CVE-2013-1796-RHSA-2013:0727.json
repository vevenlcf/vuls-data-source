  "description": "KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for\nLinux on AMD64 and Intel 64 systems. KVM is a Linux kernel module built for\nthe standard Red Hat Enterprise Linux kernel.\n\nA flaw was found in the way KVM handled guest time updates when the buffer\nthe guest registered by writing to the MSR_KVM_SYSTEM_TIME machine state\nregister (MSR) crossed a page boundary. A privileged guest user could use\nthis flaw to crash the host or, potentially, escalate their privileges,\nallowing them to execute arbitrary code at the host kernel level.\n(CVE-2013-1796)\n\nA potential use-after-free flaw was found in the way KVM handled guest time\nupdates when the GPA (guest physical address) the guest registered by\nwriting to the MSR_KVM_SYSTEM_TIME machine state register (MSR) fell into a\nmovable or removable memory region of the hosting user-space process (by\ndefault, QEMU-KVM) on the host. If that memory region is deregistered from\nKVM using KVM_SET_USER_MEMORY_REGION and the allocated virtual memory\nreused, a privileged guest user could potentially use this flaw to\nescalate their privileges on the host. (CVE-2013-1797)\n\nA flaw was found in the way KVM emulated IOAPIC (I/O Advanced Programmable\nInterrupt Controller). A missing validation check in the\nioapic_read_indirect() function could allow a privileged guest user to\ncrash the host, or read a substantial portion of host kernel memory.\n(CVE-2013-1798)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Andrew Honig of Google for reporting all of\nthese issues.\n\nAll users of kvm are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to correct these issues. Note that the procedure\nin the Solution section must be performed before this update will take\neffect.",
