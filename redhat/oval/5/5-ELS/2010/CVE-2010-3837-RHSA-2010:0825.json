  "description": "MySQL is a multi-user, multi-threaded SQL database server. It consists of\nthe MySQL server daemon (mysqld) and many client programs and libraries.\n\nIt was found that the MySQL PolyFromWKB() function did not sanity check\nWell-Known Binary (WKB) data. A remote, authenticated attacker could use\nspecially-crafted WKB data to crash mysqld. This issue only caused a\ntemporary denial of service, as mysqld was automatically restarted after\nthe crash. (CVE-2010-3840)\n\nA flaw was found in the way MySQL processed certain JOIN queries. If a\nstored procedure contained JOIN queries, and that procedure was executed\ntwice in sequence, it could cause an infinite loop, leading to excessive\nCPU use (up to 100%). A remote, authenticated attacker could use this flaw\nto cause a denial of service. (CVE-2010-3839)\n\nA flaw was found in the way MySQL processed queries that provide a mixture\nof numeric and longblob data types to the LEAST or GREATEST function. A\nremote, authenticated attacker could use this flaw to crash mysqld. This\nissue only caused a temporary denial of service, as mysqld was\nautomatically restarted after the crash. (CVE-2010-3838)\n\nA flaw was found in the way MySQL processed PREPARE statements containing\nboth GROUP_CONCAT and the WITH ROLLUP modifier. A remote, authenticated\nattacker could use this flaw to crash mysqld. This issue only caused a\ntemporary denial of service, as mysqld was automatically restarted after\nthe crash. (CVE-2010-3837)\n\nIt was found that MySQL did not properly pre-evaluate LIKE arguments in\nview prepare mode. A remote, authenticated attacker could possibly use this\nflaw to crash mysqld. (CVE-2010-3836)\n\nA flaw was found in the way MySQL processed statements that assign a value\nto a user-defined variable and that also contain a logical value\nevaluation. A remote, authenticated attacker could use this flaw to crash\nmysqld. This issue only caused a temporary denial of service, as mysqld was\nautomatically restarted after the crash. (CVE-2010-3835)\n\nA flaw was found in the way MySQL evaluated the arguments of extreme-value\nfunctions, such as LEAST and GREATEST. A remote, authenticated attacker\ncould use this flaw to crash mysqld. This issue only caused a temporary\ndenial of service, as mysqld was automatically restarted after the crash.\n(CVE-2010-3833)\n\nA flaw was found in the way MySQL processed EXPLAIN statements for some\ncomplex SELECT queries. A remote, authenticated attacker could use this\nflaw to crash mysqld. This issue only caused a temporary denial of service,\nas mysqld was automatically restarted after the crash. (CVE-2010-3682)\n\nA flaw was found in the way MySQL processed certain alternating READ\nrequests provided by HANDLER statements. A remote, authenticated attacker\ncould use this flaw to provide such requests, causing mysqld to crash. This\nissue only caused a temporary denial of service, as mysqld was\nautomatically restarted after the crash. (CVE-2010-3681)\n\nA flaw was found in the way MySQL processed CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE\nstatements that define NULL columns when using the InnoDB storage engine. A\nremote, authenticated attacker could use this flaw to crash mysqld. This\nissue only caused a temporary denial of service, as mysqld was\nautomatically restarted after the crash. (CVE-2010-3680)\n\nA flaw was found in the way MySQL processed JOIN queries that attempt to\nretrieve data from a unique SET column. A remote, authenticated attacker\ncould use this flaw to crash mysqld. This issue only caused a temporary\ndenial of service, as mysqld was automatically restarted after the crash.\n(CVE-2010-3677)\n\nAll MySQL users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing this\nupdate, the MySQL server daemon (mysqld) will be restarted automatically.",
