  "title": "RHSA-2010:0221: squid security and bug fix update (Low)",
  "description": "Squid is a high-performance proxy caching server for web clients,\nsupporting FTP, Gopher, and HTTP data objects.\n\nA flaw was found in the way Squid processed certain external ACL helper\nHTTP header fields that contained a delimiter that was not a comma. A\nremote attacker could issue a crafted request to the Squid server, causing\nexcessive CPU use (up to 100%). (CVE-2009-2855)\n\nNote: The CVE-2009-2855 issue only affected non-default configurations that\nuse an external ACL helper script.\n\nA flaw was found in the way Squid handled truncated DNS replies. A remote\nattacker able to send specially-crafted UDP packets to Squid's DNS client\nport could trigger an assertion failure in Squid's child process, causing\nthat child process to exit. (CVE-2010-0308)\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* Squid's init script returns a non-zero value when trying to stop a\nstopped service. This is not LSB compliant and can generate difficulties in\ncluster environments. This update makes stopping LSB compliant. (BZ#521926)\n\n* Squid is not currently built to support MAC address filtering in ACLs.\nThis update includes support for MAC address filtering. (BZ#496170)\n\n* Squid is not currently built to support Kerberos negotiate\nauthentication. This update enables Kerberos authentication. (BZ#516245)\n\n* Squid does not include the port number as part of URIs it constructs when\nconfigured as an accelerator. This results in a 403 error. This update\ncorrects this behavior. (BZ#538738)\n\n* the error_map feature does not work if the same handling is set also on\nthe HTTP server that operates in deflate mode. This update fixes this\nissue. (BZ#470843)\n\nAll users of squid should upgrade to this updated package, which resolves\nthese issues. After installing this update, the squid service will be\nrestarted automatically.",
