  "description": "KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for\nLinux on AMD64 and Intel 64 systems. KVM is a Linux kernel module built for\nthe standard Red Hat Enterprise Linux kernel.\n\nIt was found that some structure padding and reserved fields in certain\ndata structures in QEMU-KVM were not initialized properly before being\ncopied to user-space. A privileged host user with access to \"/dev/kvm\"\ncould use this flaw to leak kernel stack memory to user-space.\n(CVE-2010-3881)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Vasiliy Kulikov for reporting this issue.\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* The 'kvm_amd' kernel module did not initialize the TSC (Time Stamp\nCounter) offset in the VMCB (Virtual Machine Control Block) correctly.\nAfter a vCPU (virtual CPU) has been created, the TSC offset in the VMCB\nshould have a negative value so that the virtual machine will see TSC\nvalues starting at zero. However, the TSC offset was set to zero and\ntherefore the virtual machine saw the same TSC value as the host. With this\nupdate, the TSC offset has been updated to show the correct values.\n(BZ#656984)\n\n* Setting the boot settings of a virtual machine to, firstly, boot from PXE\nand, secondly, to boot from the hard drive would result in a PXE boot loop,\nthat is, the virtual machine would not continue to boot from the hard drive\nif the PXE boot failed. This was caused by a flaw in the 'bochs-bios' (part\nof KVM) code. With this update, after a virtual machine tries to boot from\nPXE and fails, it continues to boot from a hard drive if there is one\npresent. (BZ#659850)\n\n* If a 64-bit Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.5 virtual machine was migrated to\nanother host with a different CPU clock speed, the clock of that virtual\nmachine would consistently lose or gain time (approximately half a second\nfor every second the host is running). On machines that do not use the kvm\nclock, the network time protocol daemon (ntpd) could correct the time\ndrifts caused by migration. However, using the pvclock caused the time to\nchange consistently. This was due to flaws in the save/load functions of\npvclock. With this update, the issue has been fixed and migrating a virtual\nmachine no longer causes time drift. (BZ#660239)\n\nAll KVM users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported patches to correct these issues. Note: The procedure in the\nSolution section must be performed before this update will take effect.",
