  "description": "KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for\nLinux on AMD64 and Intel 64 systems. KVM is a Linux kernel module built for\nthe standard Red Hat Enterprise Linux kernel.\n\nA flaw was found in the way QEMU-KVM handled erroneous data provided by\nthe Linux virtio-net driver, used by guest operating systems. Due to a\ndeficiency in the TSO (TCP segment offloading) implementation, a guest's\nvirtio-net driver would transmit improper data to a certain QEMU-KVM\nprocess on the host, causing the guest to crash. A remote attacker could\nuse this flaw to send specially-crafted data to a target guest system,\ncausing that guest to crash. (CVE-2010-0741)\n\nAdditionally, these updated packages include numerous bug fixes and\nenhancements. Refer to the KVM chapter of the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.5\nTechnical Notes for details:\n\nhttp://www.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/5.5/html/Technical_Notes/kvm.html       \n\nAll KVM users should upgrade to these updated packages, which resolve this\nissue as well as fixing the bugs and adding the enhancements noted in the\nTechnical Notes. Note: The procedure in the Solution section must be\nperformed before this update will take effect.",
