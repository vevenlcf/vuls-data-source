  "description": "Network Security Services (NSS) is a set of libraries designed to support\nthe cross-platform development of security-enabled client and server\napplications.\n\nA flaw was found in the way TLS False Start was implemented in NSS.\nAn attacker could use this flaw to potentially return unencrypted\ninformation from the server. (CVE-2013-1740)\n\nA race condition was found in the way NSS implemented session ticket\nhandling as specified by RFC 5077. An attacker could use this flaw to crash\nan application using NSS or, in rare cases, execute arbitrary code with the\nprivileges of the user running that application. (CVE-2014-1490)\n\nIt was found that NSS accepted weak Diffie-Hellman Key exchange (DHKE)\nparameters. This could possibly lead to weak encryption being used in\ncommunication between the client and the server. (CVE-2014-1491)\n\nAn out-of-bounds write flaw was found in NSPR. A remote attacker could\npotentially use this flaw to crash an application using NSPR or, possibly,\nexecute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running that\napplication. This NSPR flaw was not exposed to web content in any shipped\nversion of Firefox. (CVE-2014-1545)\n\nIt was found that the implementation of Internationalizing Domain Names in\nApplications (IDNA) hostname matching in NSS did not follow the RFC 6125\nrecommendations. This could lead to certain invalid certificates with\ninternational characters to be accepted as valid. (CVE-2014-1492)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting the\nCVE-2014-1490, CVE-2014-1491, and CVE-2014-1545 issues. Upstream\nacknowledges Brian Smith as the original reporter of CVE-2014-1490, Antoine\nDelignat-Lavaud and Karthikeyan Bhargavan as the original reporters of\nCVE-2014-1491, and Abhishek Arya as the original reporter of CVE-2014-1545.\n\nThe nss and nspr packages have been upgraded to upstream version 3.16.1 and\n4.10.6 respectively, which provide a number of bug fixes and enhancements\nover the previous versions. (BZ#1110857, BZ#1110860)\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* Previously, when the output.log file was not present on the system, the\nshell in the Network Security Services (NSS) specification handled test\nfailures incorrectly as false positive test results. Consequently, certain\nutilities, such as \"grep\", could not handle failures properly. This update\nimproves error detection in the specification file, and \"grep\" and other\nutilities now handle missing files or crashes as intended. (BZ#1035281)\n\n* Prior to this update, a subordinate Certificate Authority (CA) of the\nANSSI agency incorrectly issued an intermediate certificate installed on a\nnetwork monitoring device. As a consequence, the monitoring device was\nenabled to act as an MITM (Man in the Middle) proxy performing traffic\nmanagement of domain names or IP addresses that the certificate holder did\nnot own or control. The trust in the intermediate certificate to issue the\ncertificate for an MITM device has been revoked, and such a device can no\nlonger be used for MITM attacks. (BZ#1042684)\n\n* Due to a regression, MD5 certificates were rejected by default because\nNetwork Security Services (NSS) did not trust MD5 certificates. With this\nupdate, MD5 certificates are supported in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.\n(BZ#11015864)\n\nUsers of nss and nspr are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,\nwhich correct these issues and add these enhancements.",
