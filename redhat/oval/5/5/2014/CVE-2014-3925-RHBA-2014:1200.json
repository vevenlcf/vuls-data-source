  "title": "RHBA-2014:1200: sos bug fix update (Low)",
  "description": "The sos package contains a set of utilities that gather information from system\nhardware, logs, and configuration files. The information can then be used for\ndiagnostic purposes and debugging.\n\nThis update fixes the following bugs:\n\n* Previously, the sosreport utility did not include the output of the \"brctl\nshow\" command for all systems. Consequently, information on bridged network\nconfigurations was only available in the report tarball on systems using Xen for\nvirtualization. With this update, the networking module collects the output of\n\"brctl show\" as well as \"brctl showstp\" commands for each configured bridge, and\nthus bridged network configuration information is now available in the report\ntarball for all hosts. (BZ#833406) \n\n* Previous versions of the sosreport utility used the legacy ifconfig command to\ndetect network interfaces, but ifconfig did not support interfaces named via\nbiosdevname. As a consequence, no information on biosdevname interfaces was\npresent in the report tarball. With this update, the sosreport networking\nplug-in now uses the \"ip\" command to detect interfaces of all types, and full\ninformation on biosdevname interfaces is now included. (BZ#980177) \n\n* Previously, the sosreport utility collected the krb5.keytab file from Kerberos\ninstallations. Although encrypted, this file can contain sensitive key material.\nWith this update, sosreport collects a summary of krb5.keytab using the klist\ncommand but does not collect the krb5.keytab file itself. As a result,\nkrb5.keytab data is still available but no sensitive information is included in\nthe report tarball. (BZ#1029017)\n\n* Previously, the sosreport \"ds\" plug-in collected all directory server logs by\ndefault. Depending on the log configuration, this could lead to very large\nreport sizes. With this update, sosreport collects by default only the current\nversion of the directory server logs regarding to \"access\", \"errors\" and\n\"audit\", and rotated logs are not collected by default. In addition, the plug-in\nnow supports an \"all_logs\" option that can be used to request the old behavior.\nAs a result, the default report size for directory server hosts is now smaller\nand more consistent unless full log data is explicitly requested. (BZ#1086736)\n\n* Prior to this update, the sosreport utility could include password material in\nthe grub.conf and fstab files collected by the boot loader and file system\nplug-ins if present on the collection system. Consequently, passwords, either\nplain text or hashed, could be included in the report tarball. With this bug fix\nupdate, password and other secrets are now removed during collection, and\npasswords from the fstab or grub.conf files can no longer appear in the report\ntarball. (BZ#1107751) \n\nUsers of sos are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which fixes these\nbugs.",
