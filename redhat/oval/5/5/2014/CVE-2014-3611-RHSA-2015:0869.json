  "description": "KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for\nLinux on AMD64 and Intel 64 systems. KVM is a Linux kernel module built for\nthe standard Red Hat Enterprise Linux kernel.\n\nIt was found that KVM's Write to Model Specific Register (WRMSR)\ninstruction emulation would write non-canonical values passed in by the\nguest to certain MSRs in the host's context. A privileged guest user could\nuse this flaw to crash the host. (CVE-2014-3610)\n\nA race condition flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's KVM subsystem\nhandled PIT (Programmable Interval Timer) emulation. A guest user who has\naccess to the PIT I/O ports could use this flaw to crash the host.\n(CVE-2014-3611)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Lars Bull of Google and Nadav Amit for\nreporting the CVE-2014-3610 issue, and Lars Bull of Google for reporting\nthe CVE-2014-3611 issue.\n\nAll kvm users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to correct these issues. Note: The procedure in\nthe Solution section must be performed before this update will take effect.",
