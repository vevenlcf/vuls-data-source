  "description": "These packages provide the OpenJDK 6 Java Runtime Environment and the\nOpenJDK 6 Software Development Kit. The Java Runtime Environment (JRE)\ncontains the software and tools that users need to run applications written\nusing the Java programming language.\n\nA flaw was found in the way that the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) handled\ntemporary font files. A malicious applet could use this flaw to use large\namounts of disk space, causing a denial of service. (CVE-2006-2426)\n\nA memory leak flaw was found in LittleCMS (embedded in OpenJDK). An\napplication using color profiles could use excessive amounts of memory, and\npossibly crash after using all available memory, if used to open\nspecially-crafted images. (CVE-2009-0581)\n\nMultiple integer overflow flaws which could lead to heap-based buffer\noverflows, as well as multiple insufficient input validation flaws, were\nfound in the way LittleCMS handled color profiles. An attacker could use\nthese flaws to create a specially-crafted image file which could cause a\nJava application to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code when opened.\n(CVE-2009-0723, CVE-2009-0733)\n\nA null pointer dereference flaw was found in LittleCMS. An application\nusing color profiles could crash while converting a specially-crafted image\nfile. (CVE-2009-0793)\n\nA flaw in the Java API for XML Web Services (JAX-WS) service endpoint\nhandling could allow a remote attacker to cause a denial of service on the\nserver application hosting the JAX-WS service endpoint. (CVE-2009-1101)\n\nA flaw in the way the Java Runtime Environment initialized LDAP connections\ncould allow a remote, authenticated user to cause a denial of service on\nthe LDAP service. (CVE-2009-1093)\n\nA flaw in the Java Runtime Environment LDAP client could allow malicious\ndata from an LDAP server to cause arbitrary code to be loaded and then run\non an LDAP client. (CVE-2009-1094)\n\nSeveral buffer overflow flaws were found in the Java Runtime Environment\nunpack200 functionality. An untrusted applet could extend its privileges,\nallowing it to read and write local files, as well as to execute local\napplications with the privileges of the user running the applet.\n(CVE-2009-1095, CVE-2009-1096)\n\nA flaw in the Java Runtime Environment Virtual Machine code generation\nfunctionality could allow untrusted applets to extend their privileges. An\nuntrusted applet could extend its privileges, allowing it to read and write\nlocal files, as well as execute local applications with the privileges\nof the user running the applet. (CVE-2009-1102)\n\nA buffer overflow flaw was found in the splash screen processing. A remote\nattacker could extend privileges to read and write local files, as well as\nto execute local applications with the privileges of the user running the\njava process. (CVE-2009-1097)\n\nA buffer overflow flaw was found in how GIF images were processed. A remote\nattacker could extend privileges to read and write local files, as well as\nexecute local applications with the privileges of the user running the\njava process. (CVE-2009-1098)\n\nNote: The flaws concerning applets in this advisory, CVE-2009-1095,\nCVE-2009-1096, and CVE-2009-1102, can only be triggered in\njava-1.6.0-openjdk by calling the \"appletviewer\" application.\n\nAll users of java-1.6.0-openjdk are advised to upgrade to these updated\npackages, which resolve these issues. All running instances of OpenJDK Java\nmust be restarted for the update to take effect.",
