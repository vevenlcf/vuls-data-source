  "description": "KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for\nLinux on AMD64 and Intel 64 systems. KVM is a Linux kernel module built for\nthe standard Red Hat Enterprise Linux kernel.\n\nA heap overflow flaw was found in the way QEMU-KVM emulated the e1000\nnetwork interface card. A privileged guest user in a virtual machine whose\nnetwork interface is configured to use the e1000 emulated driver could use\nthis flaw to crash the host or, possibly, escalate their privileges on the\nhost. (CVE-2012-0029)\n\nA flaw was found in the way the KVM subsystem of a Linux kernel handled PIT\n(Programmable Interval Timer) IRQs (interrupt requests) when there was no\nvirtual interrupt controller set up. A malicious user in the kvm group on\nthe host could force this situation to occur, resulting in the host\ncrashing. (CVE-2011-4622)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Nicolae Mogoreanu for reporting CVE-2012-0029.\n\nAll KVM users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported patches to correct these issues. Note: The procedure in the\nSolution section must be performed before this update will take effect.",
