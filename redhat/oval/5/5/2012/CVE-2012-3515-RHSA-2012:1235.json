  "title": "RHSA-2012:1235: kvm security update (Important)",
  "description": "KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for\nLinux on AMD64 and Intel 64 systems. KVM is a Linux kernel module built\nfor the standard Red Hat Enterprise Linux kernel.\n\nA flaw was found in the way QEMU handled VT100 terminal escape sequences\nwhen emulating certain character devices. A guest user with privileges to\nwrite to a character device that is emulated on the host using a virtual\nconsole back-end could use this flaw to crash the qemu-kvm process on the\nhost or, possibly, escalate their privileges on the host. (CVE-2012-3515)\n\nThis flaw did not affect the default use of KVM. Affected configurations\nwere:\n\n* When guests were started from the command line (\"/usr/libexec/qemu-kvm\"),\nand without specifying a serial or parallel device that specifically does\nnot use a virtual console (vc) back-end. (Note that Red Hat does not\nsupport invoking \"qemu-kvm\" from the command line on Red Hat Enterprise\nLinux 5.)\n\n* Guests that were managed via libvirt, such as when using Virtual Machine\nManager (virt-manager), but that have a serial or parallel device that uses\na virtual console back-end. By default, guests managed via libvirt will not\nuse a virtual console back-end for such devices.\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the Xen project for reporting this issue.\n\nAll KVM users should upgrade to these updated packages, which correct this\nissue. Note: The procedure in the Solution section must be performed before\nthis update will take effect.",
