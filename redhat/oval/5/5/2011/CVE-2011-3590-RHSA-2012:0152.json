  "title": "RHSA-2012:0152: kexec-tools security, bug fix, and enhancement update (Moderate)",
  "description": "The kexec-tools package contains the /sbin/kexec binary and utilities that \ntogether form the user-space component of the kernel's kexec feature. The \n/sbin/kexec binary facilitates a new kernel to boot using the kernel's \nkexec feature either on a normal or a panic reboot. The kexec fastboot \nmechanism allows booting a Linux kernel from the context of an already \nrunning kernel.\n\nKdump used the SSH (Secure Shell) \"StrictHostKeyChecking=no\" option when\ndumping to SSH targets, causing the target kdump server's SSH host key not\nto be checked. This could make it easier for a man-in-the-middle attacker\non the local network to impersonate the kdump SSH target server and\npossibly gain access to sensitive information in the vmcore dumps.\n(CVE-2011-3588)\n\nThe mkdumprd utility created initrd files with world-readable permissions.\nA local user could possibly use this flaw to gain access to sensitive \ninformation, such as the private SSH key used to authenticate to a remote \nserver when kdump was configured to dump to an SSH target. (CVE-2011-3589)\n\nThe mkdumprd utility included unneeded sensitive files (such as all files \nfrom the \"/root/.ssh/\" directory and the host's private SSH keys) in the \nresulting initrd. This could lead to an information leak when initrd \nfiles were previously created with world-readable permissions. Note: With \nthis update, only the SSH client configuration, known hosts files, and the \nSSH key configured via the newly introduced sshkey option in \n\"/etc/kdump.conf\" are included in the initrd. The default is the key \ngenerated when running the \"service kdump propagate\" command, \n\"/root/.ssh/kdump_id_rsa\". (CVE-2011-3590)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Kevan Carstensen for reporting these issues.\n\nThis updated kexec-tools package also includes numerous bug fixes and\nenhancements. Space precludes documenting all of these changes in this\nadvisory. Users are directed to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.8 Technical\nNotes, linked to in the References, for information on the most significant\nof these changes.\n\nAll users of kexec-tools are advised to upgrade to this updated package, \nwhich resolves these security issues, fixes these bugs and adds these \nenhancements.",
