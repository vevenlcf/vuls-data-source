  "description": "The GNU Privacy Guard (GnuPG or GPG) is a tool for encrypting data and\ncreating digital signatures, compliant with the proposed OpenPGP Internet\nstandard and the S/MIME standard.\n\nIt was found that GnuPG was vulnerable to the Yarom/Falkner flush+reload\ncache side-channel attack on the RSA secret exponent. An attacker able to\nexecute a process on the logical CPU that shared the L3 cache with the\nGnuPG process (such as a different local user or a user of a KVM guest\nrunning on the same host with the kernel same-page merging functionality\nenabled) could possibly use this flaw to obtain portions of the RSA secret\nkey. (CVE-2013-4242)\n\nA denial of service flaw was found in the way GnuPG parsed certain\ncompressed OpenPGP packets. An attacker could use this flaw to send\nspecially crafted input data to GnuPG, making GnuPG enter an infinite loop\nwhen parsing data. (CVE-2013-4402)\n\nIt was found that importing a corrupted public key into a GnuPG keyring\ndatabase corrupted that keyring. An attacker could use this flaw to trick a\nlocal user into importing a specially crafted public key into their keyring\ndatabase, causing the keyring to be corrupted and preventing its further\nuse. (CVE-2012-6085)\n\nIt was found that GnuPG did not properly interpret the key flags in a PGP\nkey packet. GPG could accept a key for uses not indicated by its holder.\n(CVE-2013-4351)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Werner Koch for reporting the CVE-2013-4402\nissue. Upstream acknowledges Taylor R Campbell as the original reporter.\n\nAll gnupg users are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which\ncontains backported patches to correct these issues.",
