  "description": "The Cluster Manager (cman) utility provides user-level services for\nmanaging a Linux cluster.\n\nChanges in this update:\n\n* fence_rsa fails to login with new RSA II firmware. (BZ#549473)\n\n* fence_virsh reports vm status incorrectly. (BZ#544664)\n\n* improve error messages from ccsd if there is a network problem.\n(BZ#517399)\n\n* new fence agent for VMWare. (BZ#548577)\n\nNote: this is a Tech Preview only.\n\n* fence agent for HP iLO2 MP. (BZ#508722)\n\n* fence agent for RSB ends with traceback. (BZ#545054)\n\n* security feature for SNMP based agent: apc_snmp \u0026 ibmblade. (BZ#532922)\n\n* change default timeout values for various fence agents. (BZ#549124)\n\n* \"Option -V\" (show version) was not working in all fence agents.\n(BZ#549113)\n\n* automatically configure consensus based on token timeout. (BZ#544482)\n\n* add readconfig \u0026 dumpconfig to fence_tool. (BZ#514662)\n\n* make groupd handle partition merges. (BZ#546082)\n\n* groupd: clean up leaving failed node. (BZ#521817)\n\n* scsi_reserve should always echo after failure. (BZ#514260)\n\n* fence_scsi_test: add debug information. (BZ#516763)\n\n* fence_scsi_test should not allow -c \u0026 -s options together. (BZ#528832)\n\n* fix fence_ipmilan read from unitialized memory. (BZ#532138)\n\n* make qdiskd stop crying wolf. (BZ#532773)\n\n* fencing failed when used without telnet or ssh. (BZ#512343)\n\n* APC changed product name (MasterSwitch -\u003e Switched Rack PDU). (BZ#447481)\n\n* fix invalid initalization introduced by retry-on option.\n\n* broken device detection for DRAC3 ERA/O. (BZ#489809)\n\n* fix case sensitivities in action parameter. (BZ#528938)\n\n* fencing_snmp failed on all operations \u0026 traceback fix. (BZ#528916)\n\n* accept unknown options from standard input. (BZ#532920)\n\n* fence_apc unable to obtain plug status. (BZ#532916)\n\n* timeout options added. (BZ#507514)\n\n* better default timeout for bladecenter. (BZ#526806)\n\n* the LOGIN_TIMEOUT value was too short for fence_lpar \u0026 the SSH login\ntimed out before the connection could be completed. (BZ#546340)\n\n* add missing-as-off option (missing blade/device is always OFF).\n(BZ#248006)\n\n* make qdiskd \"master-wins\" node work. (BZ#372901)\n\n* make qdisk self-fence system if write errors take longer than\ninterval*tko. (BZ#511113)\n\n* make service_cman.lcrso executable, so RPM adds it to the debuginfo pkg.\n(BZ#511346)\n\n* don't check for xm command in cman init script: virsh is more\nappropriate. (BZ#516111)\n\n* allow re-registering of a quorum device. (BZ#525270)\n\n* fix fence_scsi, multipath \u0026 persistent reservations. (BZ#516625)\n\n* cman_tool leave remove reduces quorum when no services are connected.\n(BZ#515446)\n\n* fence_sanbox2 unable to retrieve status. (BZ#512947)\n\n* gfs_controld: GETLK should free unused resource. (BZ#513285)\n\n* allow IP addresses as node names. (BZ#504158)\n\n* fence_scsi man page contains invalid option. (BZ#515731)\n\n* fence_scsi support for 2 node clusters. (BZ#516085)\n\n* Support for power cycle in fence ipmi. (BZ#482913)\n\n* add option 'list devices' for fencing agents. (BZ#519697)\n\n* add support for switching IPv4/IPv6. (BZ#520458)\n\n* fence agent ends with traceback if option is missing. (BZ#508262)\n\n* command line options to override default ports for different services,\nsuch as SSH \u0026 Telnet (i.e. -u option) were added. (BZ#506928)\n\nNote: \"-u\" does not currently work with fence_wti. Other agents honor the\nport override command line options properly, however. (BZ#506928)\n\n* force stdout close for fencing agents. (BZ#518622)\n\n* support for long options. (BZ#519670)\n\n* fix a situation where cman could kill the wrong nodes. (BZ#513260)\n\n* fix support for \u003e100 gfs \u0026 gfs2 file systems. (BZ#561892)\n\n* fix a problem where 'dm suspend' would hang a withdrawn GFS file system.\n(BZ#570530)\n\n* fix a problem where fence_snmp returned success when the operation\nfailed.
