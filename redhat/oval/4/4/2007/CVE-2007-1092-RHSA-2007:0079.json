  "title": "RHSA-2007:0079: Firefox security update (Critical)",
  "description": "Mozilla Firefox is an open source Web browser.\n\nSeveral flaws were found in the way Firefox processed certain malformed\nJavaScript code. A malicious web page could execute JavaScript code in such\na way that may result in Firefox crashing or executing arbitrary code as\nthe user running Firefox. (CVE-2007-0775, CVE-2007-0777)\n\nSeveral cross-site scripting (XSS) flaws were found in the way Firefox\nprocessed certain malformed web pages. A malicious web page could display\nmisleading information which may result in a user unknowingly divulging\nsensitive information such as a password. (CVE-2006-6077, CVE-2007-0995,\nCVE-2007-0996)\n\nA flaw was found in the way Firefox cached web pages on the local disk. A\nmalicious web page may be able to inject arbitrary HTML into a browsing\nsession if the user reloads a targeted site. (CVE-2007-0778)\n\nA flaw was found in the way Firefox displayed certain web content. A\nmalicious web page could generate content which could overlay user\ninterface elements such as the hostname and security indicators, tricking a\nuser into thinking they are visiting a different site. (CVE-2007-0779)\n\nTwo flaws were found in the way Firefox displayed blocked popup windows. If\na user can be convinced to open a blocked popup, it is possible to read\narbitrary local files, or conduct an XSS attack against the user.\n(CVE-2007-0780, CVE-2007-0800)\n\nTwo buffer overflow flaws were found in the Network Security Services (NSS)\ncode for processing the SSLv2 protocol. Connecting to a malicious secure\nweb server could cause the execution of arbitrary code as the user running\nFirefox. (CVE-2007-0008, CVE-2007-0009)\n\nA flaw was found in the way Firefox handled the \"location.hostname\" value\nduring certain browser domain checks. This flaw could allow a malicious web\nsite to set domain cookies for an arbitrary site, or possibly perform an\nXSS attack. (CVE-2007-0981)\n\nUsers of Firefox are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages, which\ncontain Firefox version 1.5.0.10 that corrects these issues.",
