  "description": "Mozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client.\n\nSeveral flaws were found in the way Thunderbird processed certain malformed\nJavaScript code. A malicious HTML mail message could execute JavaScript\ncode in such a way that may result in Thunderbird crashing or executing\narbitrary code as the user running Thunderbird. JavaScript support is\ndisabled by default in Thunderbird; these issues are not exploitable unless\nthe user has enabled JavaScript. (CVE-2007-0775, CVE-2007-0777, CVE-2007-1092)\n\nA flaw was found in the way Thunderbird processed text/enhanced and\ntext/richtext formatted mail message. A specially crafted mail message\ncould execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running\nThunderbird. (CVE-2007-1282)\n\nSeveral cross-site scripting (XSS) flaws were found in the way Thunderbird\nprocessed certain malformed HTML mail messages. A malicious HTML mail\nmessage could display misleading information which may result in a user\nunknowingly divulging sensitive information such as a password.\n(CVE-2006-6077, CVE-2007-0995, CVE-2007-0996)\n\nA flaw was found in the way Thunderbird cached web content on the local\ndisk. A malicious HTML mail message may be able to inject arbitrary HTML\ninto a browsing session if the user reloads a targeted site. (CVE-2007-0778)\n\nA flaw was found in the way Thunderbird displayed certain web content. A\nmalicious HTML mail message could generate content which could overlay user\ninterface elements such as the hostname and security indicators, tricking a\nuser into thinking they are visiting a different site. (CVE-2007-0779)\n\nTwo flaws were found in the way Thunderbird displayed blocked popup\nwindows. If a user can be convinced to open a blocked popup, it is possible\nto read arbitrary local files, or conduct an XSS attack against the user.\n(CVE-2007-0780, CVE-2007-0800)\n\nTwo buffer overflow flaws were found in the Network Security Services (NSS)\ncode for processing the SSLv2 protocol. Connecting to a malicious secure\nweb server could cause the execution of arbitrary code as the user running\nThunderbird. (CVE-2007-0008, CVE-2007-0009)\n\nA flaw was found in the way Thunderbird handled the \"location.hostname\"\nvalue during certain browser domain checks. This flaw could allow a\nmalicious HTML mail message to set domain cookies for an arbitrary site, or\npossibly perform an XSS attack. (CVE-2007-0981)\n\nUsers of Thunderbird are advised to apply this update, which contains\nThunderbird version 1.5.0.10 that corrects these issues.",
