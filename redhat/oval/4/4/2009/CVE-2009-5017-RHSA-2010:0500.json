  "title": "RHSA-2010:0500: firefox security, bug fix, and enhancement update (Critical)",
  "description": "Mozilla Firefox is an open source web browser.\n\nSeveral flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web\npage containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or,\npotentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running\nFirefox. (CVE-2010-1121, CVE-2010-1200, CVE-2010-1202, CVE-2010-1203)\n\nA flaw was found in the way browser plug-ins interact. It was possible for\na plug-in to reference the freed memory from a different plug-in, resulting\nin the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running\nFirefox. (CVE-2010-1198)\n\nSeveral integer overflow flaws were found in the processing of malformed\nweb content. A web page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to\ncrash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the\nuser running Firefox. (CVE-2010-1196, CVE-2010-1199)\n\nA focus stealing flaw was found in the way Firefox handled focus changes. A\nmalicious website could use this flaw to steal sensitive data from a user,\nsuch as usernames and passwords. (CVE-2010-1125)\n\nA flaw was found in the way Firefox handled the \"Content-Disposition:\nattachment\" HTTP header when the \"Content-Type: multipart\" HTTP header was\nalso present. A website that allows arbitrary uploads and relies on the\n\"Content-Disposition: attachment\" HTTP header to prevent content from being\ndisplayed inline, could be used by an attacker to serve malicious content\nto users. (CVE-2010-1197)\n\nA flaw was found in the Firefox Math.random() function. This function could\nbe used to identify a browsing session and track a user across different\nwebsites. (CVE-2008-5913)\n\nA flaw was found in the Firefox XML document loading security checks.\nCertain security checks were not being called when an XML document was\nloaded. This could possibly be leveraged later by an attacker to load\ncertain resources that violate the security policies of the browser or its\nadd-ons. Note that this issue cannot be exploited by only loading an XML\ndocument. (CVE-2010-0182)\n\nFor technical details regarding these flaws, refer to the Mozilla security\nadvisories for Firefox 3.6.4. You can find a link to the Mozilla advisories\nin the References section of this erratum.\n\nThis erratum upgrades Firefox from version 3.0.19 to version 3.6.4, and as\nsuch, contains multiple bug fixes and numerous enhancements. Space\nprecludes documenting these changes in this advisory. For details\nconcerning these changes, refer to the Firefox Release Notes links in the\nReferences section of this erratum.\n\nImportant: Firefox 3.6.4 is not completely backwards-compatible with all\nMozilla Add-ons and Firefox plug-ins that worked with Firefox 3.0.19.\nFirefox 3.6 checks compatibility on first-launch, and, depending on the\nindividual configuration and the installed Add-ons and plug-ins, may\ndisable said Add-ons and plug-ins, or attempt to check for updates and\nupgrade them. Add-ons and plug-ins may have to be manually updated.\n\nAll Firefox users should upgrade to this updated package, which contains\nFirefox version 3.6.4. After installing the update, Firefox must be\nrestarted for the changes to take effect.",
