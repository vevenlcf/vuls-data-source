  "description": "The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux\noperating system.\n\nSecurity fixes:\n\n* a NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the Linux kernel NFSv4\nimplementation. Several of the NFSv4 file locking functions failed to check\nwhether a file had been opened on the server before performing locking\noperations on it. A local, unprivileged user on a system with an NFSv4\nshare mounted could possibly use this flaw to cause a kernel panic (denial\nof service) or escalate their privileges. (CVE-2009-3726, Important)\n\n* a flaw was found in the sctp_process_unk_param() function in the Linux\nkernel Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) implementation. A remote\nattacker could send a specially-crafted SCTP packet to an SCTP listening\nport on a target system, causing a kernel panic (denial of service).\n(CVE-2010-1173, Important)\n\n* a race condition between finding a keyring by name and destroying a freed\nkeyring was found in the Linux kernel key management facility. A local,\nunprivileged user could use this flaw to cause a kernel panic (denial of\nservice) or escalate their privileges. (CVE-2010-1437, Important)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Simon Vallet for responsibly reporting\nCVE-2009-3726; and Jukka Taimisto and Olli Jarva of Codenomicon Ltd, Nokia\nSiemens Networks, and Wind River on behalf of their customer, for\nresponsibly reporting CVE-2010-1173.\n\nBug fixes:\n\n* RHBA-2007:0791 introduced a regression in the Journaling Block Device\n(JBD). Under certain circumstances, removing a large file (such as 300 MB\nor more) did not result in inactive memory being freed, leading to the\nsystem having a large amount of inactive memory. Now, the memory is\ncorrectly freed. (BZ#589155)\n\n* the timer_interrupt() routine did not scale lost real ticks to logical\nticks correctly, possibly causing time drift for 64-bit Red Hat Enterprise\nLinux 4 KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) guests that were booted with the\n\"divider=x\" kernel parameter set to a value greater than 1. \"warning: many\nlost ticks\" messages may have been logged on the affected guest systems.\n(BZ#590551)\n\n* a bug could have prevented NFSv3 clients from having the most up-to-date\nfile attributes for files on a given NFSv3 file system. In cases where a\nfile type changed, such as if a file was removed and replaced with a\ndirectory of the same name, the NFSv3 client may not have noticed this\nchange until stat(2) was called (for example, by running \"ls -l\").\n(BZ#596372)\n\n* RHBA-2007:0791 introduced bugs in the Linux kernel PCI-X subsystem. These\ncould have caused a system deadlock on some systems where the BIOS set the\ndefault Maximum Memory Read Byte Count (MMRBC) to 4096, and that also use\nthe Intel PRO/1000 Linux driver, e1000. Errors such as \"e1000: eth[x]:\ne1000_clean_tx_irq: Detected Tx Unit Hang\" were logged. (BZ#596374)\n\n* an out of memory condition in a KVM guest, using the virtio-net network\ndriver and also under heavy network stress, could have resulted in\nthat guest being unable to receive network traffic. Users had to manually\nremove and re-add the virtio_net module and restart the network service\nbefore networking worked as expected. Such memory conditions no longer\nprevent KVM guests receiving network traffic. (BZ#597310)\n\n* when an SFQ qdisc that limited the queue size to two packets was added to\na network interface, sending traffic through that interface resulted in a\nkernel crash. Such a qdisc no longer results in a kernel crash. (BZ#597312)\n\n* when an NFS client opened a file with the O_TRUNC flag set, it received\na valid stateid, but did not use that stateid to perform the SETATTR call.\nSuch cases were rejected by Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 NFS servers with an\n\"NFS4ERR_BAD_STATEID\" error, possibly preventing some NFS clients from\nwriting files to an NFS file system. (BZ#597314)\n\nUsers should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported\npatches to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for this\nupdate to take effect.",
