  "description": "Mozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client.\n\nTwo flaws were found in the way Thunderbird processed certain regular\nexpressions.  A malicious HTML email could cause a crash or possibly\nexecute arbitrary code as the user running Thunderbird.  (CVE-2006-4565,\nCVE-2006-4566)\n\nA flaw was found in the Thunderbird auto-update verification system.  An\nattacker who has the ability to spoof a victim's DNS could get Firefox to\ndownload and install malicious code. In order to exploit this issue an\nattacker would also need to get a victim to previously accept an\nunverifiable certificate. (CVE-2006-4567)\n\nA flaw was found in the handling of Javascript timed events.  A malicious\nHTML email could crash the browser or possibly execute arbitrary code as\nthe user running Thunderbird. (CVE-2006-4253)\n\nDaniel Bleichenbacher recently described an implementation error in RSA\nsignature verification.  For RSA keys with exponent 3 it is possible for an\nattacker to forge a signature that which would be incorrectly verified by\nthe NSS library.  (CVE-2006-4340)\n\nA flaw was found in Thunderbird that triggered when a HTML message\ncontained a remote image pointing to a XBL script.  An attacker could have\ncreated a carefully crafted message which would execute Javascript if\ncertain actions were performed on the email by the recipient, even if\nJavascript was disabled.  (CVE-2006-4570)\n\nA number of flaws were found in Thunderbird.  A malicious HTML email could\ncause a crash or possibly execute arbitrary code as the user running\nThunderbird.  (CVE-2006-4571)\n\nUsers of Thunderbird are advised to upgrade to this update, which contains\nThunderbird version 1.5.0.7 that corrects these issues.",
