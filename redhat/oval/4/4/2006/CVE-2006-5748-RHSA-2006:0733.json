  "description": "Mozilla Firefox is an open source Web browser.\n\nSeveral flaws were found in the way Firefox processes certain malformed\nJavascript code. A malicious web page could cause the execution of\nJavascript code in such a way that could cause Firefox to crash or execute\narbitrary code as the user running Firefox. (CVE-2006-5463, CVE-2006-5747,\nCVE-2006-5748)\n\nSeveral flaws were found in the way Firefox renders web pages. A malicious\nweb page could cause the browser to crash or possibly execute arbitrary\ncode as the user running Firefox. (CVE-2006-5464) \n\nA flaw was found in the way Firefox verifies RSA signatures. For RSA keys\nwith exponent 3 it is possible for an attacker to forge a signature that\nwould be incorrectly verified by the NSS library. Firefox as shipped trusts\nseveral root Certificate Authorities that use exponent 3. An attacker could\nhave created a carefully crafted SSL certificate which be incorrectly\ntrusted when their site was visited by a victim. This flaw was previously\nthought to be fixed in Firefox 1.5.0.7, however Ulrich Kuehn discovered the\nfix was incomplete (CVE-2006-5462)\n\nUsers of Firefox are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages, which\ncontain Firefox version 1.5.0.8 that corrects these issues.",
