  "description": "GnuPG is a utility for encrypting data and creating digital signatures.\n\nTavis Ormandy discovered a bug in the way GnuPG verifies cryptographically\nsigned data with detached signatures. It is possible for an attacker to\nconstruct a cryptographically signed message which could appear to come\nfrom a third party.  When a victim processes a GnuPG message with a\nmalformed detached signature, GnuPG ignores the malformed signature,\nprocesses and outputs the signed data, and exits with status 0, just as it\nwould if the signature had been valid.  In this case, GnuPG's exit status\nwould not indicate that no signature verification had taken place. This\nissue would primarily be of concern when processing GnuPG results via an\nautomated script. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assigned\nthe name CVE-2006-0455 to this issue.\n\nTavis Ormandy also discovered a bug in the way GnuPG verifies\ncryptographically signed data with inline signatures. It is possible for an\nattacker to inject unsigned data into a signed message in such a way that\nwhen a victim processes the message to recover the data, the unsigned data\nis output along with the signed data, giving the appearance of having been\nsigned.  This issue is mitigated in the GnuPG shipped with Red Hat\nEnterprise Linux as the --ignore-crc-error option must be passed to the gpg\nexecutable for this attack to be successful. The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project assigned the name CVE-2006-0049 to this issue.\n\nNote that neither of these issues affect the way RPM or up2date verify RPM\npackage files, nor is RPM vulnerable to either of these issues.\n\nAll users of GnuPG are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which\ncontains backported patches to correct these issues.",
