  "description": "SquirrelMail is a standards-based webmail package written in PHP4.\n\nA bug was found in the way SquirrelMail presents the right frame to the\nuser. If a user can be tricked into opening a carefully crafted URL, it is\npossible to present the user with arbitrary HTML data. (CVE-2006-0188)\n\nA bug was found in the way SquirrelMail filters incoming HTML email. It is\npossible to cause a victim's web browser to request remote content by\nopening a HTML email while running a web browser that processes certain\ntypes of invalid style sheets. Only Internet Explorer is known to process\nsuch malformed style sheets. (CVE-2006-0195)\n\nA bug was found in the way SquirrelMail processes a request to select an\nIMAP mailbox. If a user can be tricked into opening a carefully crafted\nURL, it is possible to execute arbitrary IMAP commands as the user viewing\ntheir mail with SquirrelMail. (CVE-2006-0377)\n\nUsers of SquirrelMail are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which\ncontains SquirrelMail version 1.4.6 and is not vulnerable to these issues.",
