  "title": "RHSA-2006:0611: thunderbird security update (Critical)",
  "description": "Mozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client.\n\nThe Mozilla Foundation has discontinued support for the Mozilla Thunderbird\n1.0 branch. This update deprecates the Mozilla Thunderbird 1.0 branch in\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 4 in favor of the supported Mozilla Thunderbird\n1.5 branch.\n\nThis update also resolves a number of outstanding Thunderbird security issues:\n\nSeveral flaws were found in the way Thunderbird processed certain\njavascript actions. A malicious mail message could execute arbitrary\njavascript instructions with the permissions of \"chrome\", allowing the page\nto steal sensitive information or install browser malware. (CVE-2006-2776,\nCVE-2006-2784, CVE-2006-2785, CVE-2006-2787, CVE-2006-3807, CVE-2006-3809)\n\nSeveral denial of service flaws were found in the way Thunderbird processed\ncertain mail messages. A malicious web page could crash the browser or\npossibly execute arbitrary code as the user running Thunderbird.\n(CVE-2006-2779, CVE-2006-2780, CVE-2006-3801, CVE-2006-3677,\nCVE-2006-3113, CVE-2006-3803, CVE-2006-3805, CVE-2006-3806, CVE-2006-3811)\n\nSeveral flaws were found in the way Thunderbird processed certain\njavascript actions. A malicious mail message could conduct a cross-site\nscripting attack or steal sensitive information (such as cookies owned by\nother domains). (CVE-2006-3802, CVE-2006-3810)\n\nA form file upload flaw was found in the way Thunderbird handled javascript\ninput object mutation. A malicious mail message could upload an arbitrary\nlocal file at form submission time without user interaction. (CVE-2006-2782)\n\nA denial of service flaw was found in the way Thunderbird called the\ncrypto.signText() javascript function. A malicious mail message could crash\nthe browser if the victim had a client certificate loaded. (CVE-2006-2778)\n\nA flaw was found in the way Thunderbird processed Proxy AutoConfig scripts.\nA malicious Proxy AutoConfig server could execute arbitrary javascript\ninstructions with the permissions of \"chrome\", allowing the page to steal\nsensitive information or install client malware. (CVE-2006-3808)\n\nNote: Please note that JavaScript support is disabled by default in\nThunderbird. The above issues are not exploitable with JavaScript disabled. \n\nTwo flaws were found in the way Thunderbird displayed malformed inline\nvcard attachments. If a victim viewed an email message containing a\ncarefully crafted vcard it was possible to execute arbitrary code as the\nuser running Thunderbird. (CVE-2006-2781, CVE-2006-3804)\n\nA cross site scripting flaw was found in the way Thunderbird processed\nUnicode Byte-order-Mark (BOM) markers in UTF-8 mail messages. A malicious\nweb page could execute a script within the browser that a web input\nsanitizer could miss due to a malformed \"script\" tag. (CVE-2006-2783)\n\nTwo HTTP response smuggling flaws were found in the way Thunderbird\nprocessed certain invalid HTTP response headers. A malicious web site could\nreturn specially crafted HTTP response headers which may bypass HTTP proxy\nrestrictions. (CVE-2006-2786)\n\nA double free flaw was found in the way the nsIX509::getRawDER method was\ncalled. If a victim visited a carefully crafted web page, it was possible\nto crash Thunderbird. (CVE-2006-2788)\n\nUsers of Thunderbird are advised to upgrade to this update, which contains\nThunderbird version 1.5.0.5 that corrects these issues.",
