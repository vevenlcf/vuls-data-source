  "title": "RHSA-2015:1043: virtio-win security and bug fix update (Important)",
  "description": "The virtio-win package provides paravirtualized network drivers for most\nMicrosoft Windows operating systems. Paravirtualized drivers are\nvirtualization-aware drivers used by fully virtualized guests running on\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux. Fully virtualized guests using the\nparavirtualized drivers gain significantly better I/O performance than\nfully virtualized guests running without the drivers.\n\nIt was found that the Windows Virtio NIC driver did not sufficiently\nsanitize the length of the incoming IP packets, as demonstrated by a packet\nwith IP options present but the overall packet length not being adjusted to\nreflect the length of those options. A remote attacker able to send a\nspecially crafted IP packet to the guest could use this flaw to crash that\nguest. (CVE-2015-3215)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Google Project Zero for reporting this issue.\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* When creating a Windows guest using virtio drivers and direct Logical\nUnit Number (LUN) access with more than 4 SCSI disks under one\nvirtio-scsi-pci controller, the guest terminated unexpectedly with a stop\nerror, also known as the blue screen of death. This update increases the\nmaximum amount of LUNs per a single virtio-scsi-pci controller has been\nincreased to 254, which prevents the described crash from occurring.\n(BZ#1210196)\n\n* The license.txt file in the virtio-win build has been updated to include\nthe correct year number in the copyright information section. (BZ#1210195)\n\nAll virtio-win users are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which\ncontains backported patches to correct these issues.",
