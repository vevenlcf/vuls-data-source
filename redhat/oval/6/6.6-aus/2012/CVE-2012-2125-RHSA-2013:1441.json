  "description": "RubyGems is the Ruby standard for publishing and managing third-party\nlibraries.\n\nIt was found that RubyGems did not verify SSL connections. This could lead\nto man-in-the-middle attacks. (CVE-2012-2126)\n\nIt was found that, when using RubyGems, the connection could be redirected\nfrom HTTPS to HTTP. This could lead to a user believing they are installing\na gem via HTTPS, when the connection may have been silently downgraded to\nHTTP. (CVE-2012-2125)\n\nIt was discovered that the rubygems API validated version strings using an\nunsafe regular expression. An application making use of this API to process\na version string from an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a denial\nof service attack through CPU exhaustion. (CVE-2013-4287)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Rubygems upstream for reporting CVE-2013-4287.\nUpstream acknowledges Damir Sharipov as the original reporter.\n\nAll rubygems users are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which\ncontains backported patches to correct these issues.",
