  "description": "Mozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client.\n\nSeveral flaws were found in the processing of malformed content. Malicious\ncontent could cause Thunderbird to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary\ncode with the privileges of the user running Thunderbird. (CVE-2013-0775,\nCVE-2013-0780, CVE-2013-0782, CVE-2013-0783)\n\nIt was found that, after canceling a proxy server's authentication\nprompt, the address bar continued to show the requested site's address. An\nattacker could use this flaw to conduct phishing attacks by tricking a\nuser into believing they are viewing trusted content. (CVE-2013-0776)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these issues.\nUpstream acknowledges Nils, Abhishek Arya, Olli Pettay, Christoph Diehl,\nGary Kwong, Jesse Ruderman, Andrew McCreight, Joe Drew, Wayne Mery, and\nMichal Zalewski as the original reporters of these issues.\n\nNote: All issues cannot be exploited by a specially-crafted HTML mail\nmessage as JavaScript is disabled by default for mail messages. They could\nbe exploited another way in Thunderbird, for example, when viewing the full\nremote content of an RSS feed.\n\nImportant: This erratum upgrades Thunderbird to version 17.0.3 ESR.\nThunderbird 17 is not completely backwards-compatible with all Mozilla\nadd-ons and Thunderbird plug-ins that worked with Thunderbird 10.0.\nThunderbird 17 checks compatibility on first-launch, and, depending on the\nindividual configuration and the installed add-ons and plug-ins, may\ndisable said Add-ons and plug-ins, or attempt to check for updates and\nupgrade them. Add-ons and plug-ins may have to be manually updated.\n\nAll Thunderbird users should upgrade to this updated package, which\ncontains Thunderbird version 17.0.3 ESR, which corrects these issues. After\ninstalling the update, Thunderbird must be restarted for the changes to\ntake effect.",
