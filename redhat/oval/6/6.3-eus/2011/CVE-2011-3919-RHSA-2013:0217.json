  "title": "RHSA-2013:0217: mingw32-libxml2 security update (Important)",
  "description": "These packages provide the libxml2 library, a development toolbox providing\nthe implementation of various XML standards, for users of MinGW (Minimalist\nGNU for Windows).\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: The mingw32 packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 will no\nlonger be updated proactively and will be deprecated with the release of\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4. These packages were provided to support other\ncapabilities in Red Hat Enterprise Linux and were not intended for direct\ncustomer use. Customers are advised to not use these packages with\nimmediate effect. Future updates to these packages will be at Red Hat's\ndiscretion and these packages may be removed in a future minor release.\n\nA heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way libxml2 decoded\nentity references with long names. A remote attacker could provide a\nspecially-crafted XML file that, when opened in an application linked\nagainst libxml2, would cause the application to crash or, potentially,\nexecute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the\napplication. (CVE-2011-3919)\n\nA heap-based buffer underflow flaw was found in the way libxml2 decoded\ncertain entities. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted XML\nfile that, when opened in an application linked against libxml2, would\ncause the application to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with\nthe privileges of the user running the application. (CVE-2012-5134)\n\nIt was found that the hashing routine used by libxml2 arrays was\nsusceptible to predictable hash collisions. Sending a specially-crafted\nmessage to an XML service could result in longer processing time, which\ncould lead to a denial of service. To mitigate this issue, randomization\nhas been added to the hashing function to reduce the chance of an attacker\nsuccessfully causing intentional collisions. (CVE-2012-0841)\n\nMultiple flaws were found in the way libxml2 parsed certain XPath (XML Path\nLanguage) expressions. If an attacker were able to supply a\nspecially-crafted XML file to an application using libxml2, as well as an\nXPath expression for that application to run against the crafted file, it\ncould cause the application to crash. (CVE-2010-4008, CVE-2010-4494,\nCVE-2011-2821, CVE-2011-2834)\n\nTwo heap-based buffer overflow flaws were found in the way libxml2 decoded\ncertain XML files. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted XML\nfile that, when opened in an application linked against libxml2, would\ncause the application to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with\nthe privileges of the user running the application. (CVE-2011-0216,\nCVE-2011-3102)\n\nAn integer overflow flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was\nfound in the way libxml2 parsed certain XPath expressions. If an attacker\nwere able to supply a specially-crafted XML file to an application using\nlibxml2, as well as an XPath expression for that application to run against\nthe crafted file, it could cause the application to crash or, possibly,\nexecute arbitrary code. (CVE-2011-1944)\n\nAn out-of-bounds memory read flaw was found in libxml2. A remote attacker\ncould provide a specially-crafted XML file that, when opened in an\napplication linked against libxml2, would cause the application to crash.\n(CVE-2011-3905)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the Google Security Team for reporting the\nCVE-2010-4008 issue. Upstream acknowledges Bui Quang Minh from Bkis as the\noriginal reporter of CVE-2010-4008.\n\nAll users of mingw32-libxml2 are advised to upgrade to these updated\npackages, which contain backported patches to correct these issues.",
