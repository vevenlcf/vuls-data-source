  "title": "CVE-2020-28935 unbound: symbolic link traversal when writing PID file (low)",
  "description": "DOCUMENTATION: A symbolic link traversal vulnerability was found in unbound in the way it writes its PID file while starting up. This flaw allows a local attacker with access to the unbound user to set up a link to another file, owned by root, and make unbound overwrite it during its next restart, destroying the original content. The highest threat from this vulnerability is integrity. \n            \n            MITIGATION: If SELinux is enabled in Enforcing mode (the default value in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8), this kind of attack is prevented as unbound would be blocked from accessing the symbolic link file.",
