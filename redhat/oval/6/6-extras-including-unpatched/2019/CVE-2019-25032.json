  "title": "CVE-2019-25032 unbound: integer overflow in the regional allocator via regional_alloc (moderate)",
  "description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in unbound. An integer overflow in regional_alloc function may lead to a buffer overflow of the allocated buffer if the size can be controlled by an attacker and can be big enough. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as service availability.\n            STATEMENT: There is no available reproducer or proof of concept for this issue, nor it was ever proven the buffer overflow can happen in practice. Indeed in the original report this issue was considered one that might not be triggered and for this reason its Impact is Moderate. Upstream has also disputed this CVE.",
