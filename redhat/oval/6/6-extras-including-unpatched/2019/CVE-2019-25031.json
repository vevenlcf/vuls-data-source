  "title": "CVE-2019-25031 unbound: configuration injection in create_unbound_ad_servers.sh upon a successful man-in-the-middle attack against a cleartext HTTP session (important)",
  "description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in unbound. The create_unbound_ad_servers.sh bash script does not properly sanitize input data, which is retrieved using an unencrypted, unauthenticated HTTP request, before writing the configuration file allowing a man-in-the-middle attack. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data integrity and system availability.\n            STATEMENT: This issue did not affect the versions of unbound as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, and 8 as they did not include the vulnerable script create_unbound_ad_servers.sh.",
