  "title": "CVE-2016-5361 IKEv1 protocol is vulnerable to DoS amplification attack (moderate)",
  "description": "DOCUMENTATION: A traffic amplification flaw was found in the Internet Key Exchange version 1 (IKEv1) protocol. A remote attacker could use a libreswan server with IKEv1 enabled in a network traffic amplification denial of service attack against other hosts on the network by sending UDP packets with a spoofed source address to that server.\n            STATEMENT: This is a protocol flaw which affects IKEv1. All complaint implementations are therefore affected by this flaw. Red Hat Product Security team, does not consider IKEv2 to be affected.
