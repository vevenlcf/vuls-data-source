  "title": "RHSA-2015:1211: kernel security and bug fix update (Important)",
  "description": "The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux\noperating system.\n\n* It was found that the Linux kernel's implementation of vectored pipe read\nand write functionality did not take into account the I/O vectors that were\nalready processed when retrying after a failed atomic access operation,\npotentially resulting in memory corruption due to an I/O vector array\noverrun. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to crash the system\nor, potentially, escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2015-1805,\nImportant)\n\nThe security impact of this issue was discovered by Red Hat.\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* The backlog data could previously not be consumed when the\naudit_log_start() function was running even if audit_log_start() called the\nwait_for_auditd() function to consume it. As only auditd could consume the\nbacklog data, audit_log_start() terminated unexpectedly. Consequently, the\nsystem became unresponsive until the backlog timeout was up. With this\nupdate, audit_log_start() no longer terminates and the system shuts down\nand reboots gracefully in a timely manner. (BZ#1140489)\n\n* Direct I/O writes extending a parallel file could previously race to\nupdate the size of the file. If the writes executed in the out-of-order\nmanner, the file size could move backwards and push a previously completed\nwrite beyond EOF, causing it to be lost. With this update, file size\nupdates are always executed in appropriate order, thus fixing this bug.\n(BZ#1218497)\n\nAll kernel users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to correct these issues. The system must be\nrebooted for this update to take effect.",
