  "description": "The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux\noperating system.\n\n* A use-after-free flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's SCTP\nimplementation handled authentication key reference counting during INIT\ncollisions. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash the system or,\npotentially, escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2015-1421,\nImportant)\n\nThis issue was discovered by Sun Baoliang of Red Hat.\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* When ARP is disabled on an interface with an ARP entry for a neighbor\nhost present in the ARP cache, letting the cached entry expire and\nattempting to communicate with that neighbor host could cause the host MAC\naddress to not be resolved correctly after ARP is enabled again on the\ninterface. With the following workaround, the entry is not expired and the\ndescribed scenario works correctly:\n\n1) Add the maximum number of ARP entries you expect for your configuration\nto the proc/sys/net/ipv4/neigh/default/gc_thresh file.\n\n2) Ensure that relevant IP addresses are put in the ARP cache when the\nsystem boots, for example by executing the following two commands:\n\nping [IP address] -c 1\nifconfig ethX -arp\n\n(BZ#1207350)\n\n* Previously, the open() system call in some cases failed with an EBUSY\nerror if the opened file was also being renamed at the same time. With this\nupdate, the kernel automatically retries open() when this failure occurs,\nand if the retry is not successful either, open() now fails with an ESTALE\nerror. (BZ#1207813)\n\n* Previously, a race condition occurred in the build_id_cache__add_s()\nfunction, which could truncate system files. A patch has been provided to\nfix this bug, and system files are no longer truncated in the\naforementioned scenario. (BZ#1210591)\n\nAll kernel users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to correct these issues. The system must be\nrebooted for this update to take effect.",
