  "description": "Mozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client.\n\nSeveral flaws were found in the processing of malformed content. Malicious\ncontent could cause Thunderbird to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary\ncode with the privileges of the user running Thunderbird. (CVE-2013-1701)\n\nA flaw was found in the way Thunderbird generated Certificate Request\nMessage Format (CRMF) requests. An attacker could use this flaw to perform\ncross-site scripting (XSS) attacks or execute arbitrary code with the\nprivileges of the user running Thunderbird. (CVE-2013-1710)\n\nA flaw was found in the way Thunderbird handled the interaction between\nframes and browser history. An attacker could use this flaw to trick\nThunderbird into treating malicious content as if it came from the browser\nhistory, allowing for XSS attacks. (CVE-2013-1709)\n\nIt was found that the same-origin policy could be bypassed due to the way\nUniform Resource Identifiers (URI) were checked in JavaScript. An attacker\ncould use this flaw to perform XSS attacks, or install malicious add-ons\nfrom third-party pages. (CVE-2013-1713)\n\nIt was found that web workers could bypass the same-origin policy. An\nattacker could use this flaw to perform XSS attacks. (CVE-2013-1714)\n\nIt was found that, in certain circumstances, Thunderbird incorrectly\nhandled Java applets. If a user launched an untrusted Java applet via\nThunderbird, the applet could use this flaw to obtain read-only access to\nfiles on the user's local system. (CVE-2013-1717)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these issues.\nUpstream acknowledges Jeff Gilbert, Henrik Skupin, moz_bug_r_a4, Cody\nCrews, Federico Lanusse, and Georgi Guninski as the original reporters of\nthese issues.\n\nNote: All of the above issues cannot be exploited by a specially-crafted\nHTML mail message as JavaScript is disabled by default for mail messages.\nThey could be exploited another way in Thunderbird, for example, when\nviewing the full remote content of an RSS feed.\n\nAll Thunderbird users should upgrade to this updated package, which\ncontains Thunderbird version 17.0.8 ESR, which corrects these issues. After\ninstalling the update, Thunderbird must be restarted for the changes to\ntake effect.",
