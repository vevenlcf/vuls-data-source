  "title": "RHSA-2015:1409: sudo security, bug fix, and enhancement update (Moderate)",
  "description": "The sudo packages contain the sudo utility which allows system \nadministrators to provide certain users with the permission to execute \nprivileged commands, which are used for system management purposes, without \nhaving to log in as root.\n\nIt was discovered that sudo did not perform any checks of the TZ\nenvironment variable value. If sudo was configured to preserve the TZ\nenvironment variable, a local user with privileges to execute commands via\nsudo could possibly use this flaw to achieve system state changes not\npermitted by the configured commands. (CVE-2014-9680)\n\nNote: The default sudoers configuration in Red Hat Enterprise Linux removes\nthe TZ variable from the environment in which commands run by sudo are\nexecuted.\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* Previously, the sudo utility child processes could sometimes become\nunresponsive because they ignored the SIGPIPE signal. With this update,\nSIGPIPE handler is properly restored in the function that reads passwords\nfrom the user, and the child processes no longer ignore SIGPIPE. As a\nresult, sudo child processes do not hang in this situation. (BZ#1094548)\n\n* Prior to this update, the order in which sudo rules were processed did\nnot honor the user-defined sudoOrder attribute. Consequently, sudo rules\nwere processed in an undefined order even when the user defined the order\nin sudoOrder. The implementation of SSSD support in sudo has been modified\nto sort the rules according to the sudoOrder value, and sudo rules are now\nsorted in the order defined by the user in sudoOrder. (BZ#1138581)\n\n* Previously, sudo became unresponsive after the user issued a command when\na sudoers source was mentioned multiple times in the /etc/nsswitch.conf\nfile. The problem occurred when nsswitch.conf contained, for example, the\n\"sudoers: files sss sss\" entry. The sudoers source processing code has been\nfixed to correctly handle multiple instances of the same sudoers source.\nAs a result, sudo no longer hangs when a sudoers source is mentioned\nmultiple times in /etc/nsswitch.conf. (BZ#1147498)\n\nIn addition, this update adds the following enhancement:\n\n* The sudo utility now supports I/O logs compressed using the zlib library.\nWith this update, sudo can generate zlib compressed I/O logs and also\nprocess zlib compressed I/O logs generated by other versions of sudo with\nzlib support. (BZ#1106433)\n\nAll sudo users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to correct these issues and add this\nenhancement.",
