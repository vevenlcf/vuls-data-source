  "description": "These packages provide the OpenJDK 6 Java Runtime Environment and the\nOpenJDK 6 Software Development Kit.\n\nA flaw was found in the Java RMI (Remote Method Invocation) registry\nimplementation. A remote RMI client could use this flaw to execute\narbitrary code on the RMI server running the registry. (CVE-2011-3556)\n\nA flaw was found in the Java RMI registry implementation. A remote RMI\nclient could use this flaw to execute code on the RMI server with\nunrestricted privileges. (CVE-2011-3557)\n\nA flaw was found in the IIOP (Internet Inter-Orb Protocol) deserialization\ncode. An untrusted Java application or applet running in a sandbox could\nuse this flaw to bypass sandbox restrictions by deserializing\nspecially-crafted input. (CVE-2011-3521)\n\nIt was found that the Java ScriptingEngine did not properly restrict the\nprivileges of sandboxed applications. An untrusted Java application or\napplet running in a sandbox could use this flaw to bypass sandbox\nrestrictions. (CVE-2011-3544)\n\nA flaw was found in the AWTKeyStroke implementation. An untrusted Java\napplication or applet running in a sandbox could use this flaw to bypass\nsandbox restrictions. (CVE-2011-3548)\n\nAn integer overflow flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was\nfound in the Java2D code used to perform transformations of graphic shapes\nand images. An untrusted Java application or applet running in a sandbox\ncould use this flaw to bypass sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2011-3551)\n\nAn insufficient error checking flaw was found in the unpacker for JAR files\nin pack200 format. A specially-crafted JAR file could use this flaw to\ncrash the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) or, possibly, execute arbitrary code\nwith JVM privileges. (CVE-2011-3554)\n\nIt was found that HttpsURLConnection did not perform SecurityManager checks\nin the setSSLSocketFactory method. An untrusted Java application or applet\nrunning in a sandbox could use this flaw to bypass connection restrictions\ndefined in the policy. (CVE-2011-3560)\n\nA flaw was found in the way the SSL 3 and TLS 1.0 protocols used block\nciphers in cipher-block chaining (CBC) mode. An attacker able to perform a\nchosen plain text attack against a connection mixing trusted and untrusted\ndata could use this flaw to recover portions of the trusted data sent over\nthe connection. (CVE-2011-3389)\n\nNote: This update mitigates the CVE-2011-3389 issue by splitting the first\napplication data record byte to a separate SSL/TLS protocol record. This\nmitigation may cause compatibility issues with some SSL/TLS implementations\nand can be disabled using the jsse.enableCBCProtection boolean property.\nThis can be done on the command line by appending the flag\n\"-Djsse.enableCBCProtection=false\" to the java command.\n\nAn information leak flaw was found in the InputStream.skip implementation.\nAn untrusted Java application or applet could possibly use this flaw to\nobtain bytes skipped by other threads. (CVE-2011-3547)\n\nA flaw was found in the Java HotSpot virtual machine. An untrusted Java\napplication or applet could use this flaw to disclose portions of the VM\nmemory, or cause it to crash. (CVE-2011-3558)\n\nThe Java API for XML Web Services (JAX-WS) implementation in OpenJDK was\nconfigured to include the stack trace in error messages sent to clients. A\nremote client could possibly use this flaw to obtain sensitive information.\n(CVE-2011-3553)\n\nIt was found that Java applications running with SecurityManager\nrestrictions were allowed to use too many UDP sockets by default. If\nmultiple instances of a malicious application were started at the same\ntime, they could exhaust all available UDP sockets on the system.\n(CVE-2011-3552)\n\nThis erratum also upgrades the OpenJDK package to IcedTea6 1.9.10. Refer to\nthe NEWS file, linked to in the References, for further information.\n\nAll users of java-1.6.0-openjdk are advised to upgrade to these updated\npackages, which resolve these issues. All running instances of OpenJDK Java\nmust be restarted for the update to take effect.",
