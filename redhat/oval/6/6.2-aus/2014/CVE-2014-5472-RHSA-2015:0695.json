  "description": "The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux\noperating system.\n\n* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's SCTP implementation\nvalidated INIT chunks when performing Address Configuration Change\n(ASCONF). A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash the system by\nsending a specially crafted SCTP packet to trigger a NULL pointer\ndereference on the system. (CVE-2014-7841, Important)\n\n* It was found that the Linux kernel's Infiniband subsystem did not\nproperly sanitize input parameters while registering memory regions from\nuser space via the (u)verbs API. A local user with access to a\n/dev/infiniband/uverbsX device could use this flaw to crash the system or,\npotentially, escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2014-8159,\nImportant)\n\n* An integer overflow flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's Frame\nBuffer device implementation mapped kernel memory to user space via the\nmmap syscall. A local user able to access a frame buffer device file\n(/dev/fb*) could possibly use this flaw to escalate their privileges on the\nsystem. (CVE-2013-2596, Important)\n\n* It was found that the parse_rock_ridge_inode_internal() function of the\nLinux kernel's ISOFS implementation did not correctly check relocated\ndirectories when processing Rock Ridge child link (CL) tags. An attacker\nwith physical access to the system could use a specially crafted ISO image\nto crash the system or, potentially, escalate their privileges on the\nsystem. (CVE-2014-5471, CVE-2014-5472, Low)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Mellanox for reporting the CVE-2014-8159 issue.\nThe CVE-2014-7841 issue was discovered by Liu Wei of Red Hat.\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* Previously, certain network device drivers did not accept ethtool\ncommands right after they were loaded. As a consequence, the current\nsetting of the specified device driver was not applied and an error message\nwas returned. The ETHTOOL_DELAY variable has been added, which makes sure\nthe ethtool utility waits for some time before it tries to apply the\noptions settings, thus fixing the bug. (BZ#1138299)\n\n* During the memory allocation for a new socket to communicate to the\nserver, the rpciod daemon released a clean page which needed to be\ncommitted. However, the commit was queueing indefinitely as the commit\ncould only be provided with a socket connection. As a consequence, a\ndeadlock occurred in rpciod. This update sets the PF_FSTRANS flag on the\nwork queue task prior to the socket allocation, and adds the\nnfs_release_page check for the flag when deciding whether to make a commit\ncall, thus fixing this bug. (BZ#1192326)\n\nAll kernel users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to correct these issues. The system must be\nrebooted for this update to take effect.",
