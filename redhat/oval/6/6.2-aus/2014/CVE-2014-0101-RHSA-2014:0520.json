  "title": "RHSA-2014:0520: kernel security and bug fix update (Important)",
  "description": "The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux\noperating system.\n\n* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel processed an authenticated\nCOOKIE_ECHO chunk during the initialization of an SCTP connection. A remote\nattacker could use this flaw to crash the system by initiating a specially\ncrafted SCTP handshake in order to trigger a NULL pointer dereference on\nthe system. (CVE-2014-0101, Important)\n\n* A race condition flaw, leading to heap-based buffer overflows, was found\nin the way the Linux kernel's N_TTY line discipline (LDISC) implementation\nhandled concurrent processing of echo output and TTY write operations\noriginating from user space when the underlying TTY driver was PTY.\nAn unprivileged, local user could use this flaw to crash the system or,\npotentially, escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2014-0196,\nImportant)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Nokia Siemens Networks for reporting\nCVE-2014-0101.\n\nThis update also fixes the following bug:\n\n* Prior to this update, a guest-provided value was used as the head length\nof the socket buffer allocated on the host. If the host was under heavy\nmemory load and the guest-provided value was too large, the allocation\ncould have failed, resulting in stalls and packet drops in the guest's Tx\npath. With this update, the guest-provided value has been limited to a\nreasonable size so that socket buffer allocations on the host succeed\nregardless of the memory load on the host, and guests can send packets\nwithout experiencing packet drops or stalls. (BZ#1092349)\n\nAll kernel users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to correct these issues. The system must be\nrebooted for this update to take effect.",
