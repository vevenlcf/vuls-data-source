  "description": "Red Hat Identity Management is a centralized authentication, identity\nmanagement, and authorization solution for both traditional and cloud-based\nenterprise environments. It integrates components of the Red Hat Directory\nServer, MIT Kerberos, Red Hat Certificate System, NTP, and DNS. It provides\nweb browser and command-line interfaces. Its administration tools allow an\nadministrator to quickly install, set up, and administer a group of domain\ncontrollers to meet the authentication and identity management requirements\nof large-scale Linux and UNIX deployments.\n\nThe ipa component provides centrally managed Identity, Policy, and Audit.\nThe slapi-nis component provides NIS Server and Schema Compatibility\nplug-ins for Directory Server.\n\nIt was discovered that the IPA extdom Directory Server plug-in did not\ncorrectly perform memory reallocation when handling user account\ninformation. A request for a list of groups for a user that belongs to a\nlarge number of groups would cause a Directory Server to crash.\n(CVE-2015-1827)\n\nIt was discovered that the slapi-nis Directory Server plug-in did not\ncorrectly perform memory reallocation when handling user account\ninformation. A request for information about a group with many members, or\na request for a user that belongs to a large number of groups, would cause\na Directory Server to enter an infinite loop and consume an excessive\namount of CPU time. (CVE-2015-0283)\n\nThese issues were discovered by Sumit Bose of Red Hat.\n\nThis update fixes the following bugs:\n\n* Previously, users of IdM were not properly granted the default permission\nto read the \"facsimiletelephonenumber\" user attribute. This update adds\n\"facsimiletelephonenumber\" to the Access Control Instruction (ACI) for user\ndata, which makes the attribute readable to authenticated users as\nexpected. (BZ#1198430)\n\n* Prior to this update, when a DNS zone was saved in an LDAP database\nwithout a dot character (.) at the end, internal DNS commands and\noperations, such as dnsrecord-* or dnszone-*, failed. With this update, DNS\ncommands always supply the DNS zone with a dot character at the end, which\nprevents the described problem. (BZ#1198431)\n\n* After a full-server IdM restore operation, the restored server in some\ncases contained invalid data. In addition, if the restored server was used\nto reinitialize a replica, the replica then contained invalid data as well.\nTo fix this problem, the IdM API is now created correctly during the\nrestore operation, and *.ldif files are not skipped during the removal of\nRUV data. As a result, the restored server and its replica no longer\ncontain invalid data. (BZ#1199060)\n\n* Previously, a deadlock in some cases occurred during an IdM upgrade,\nwhich could cause the IdM server to become unresponsive. With this update,\nthe Schema Compatibility plug-in has been adjusted not to parse the subtree\nthat contains the configuration of the DNA plug-in, which prevents this\ndeadlock from triggering. (BZ#1199128)\n\n* When using the extdom plug-in of IdM to handle large groups, user lookups\nand group lookups previously failed due to insufficient buffer size.\nWith this update, the getgrgid_r() call gradually increases the buffer\nlength if needed, and the described failure of extdom thus no longer\noccurs. (BZ#1203204)\n\nUsers of ipa and slapi-nis are advised to upgrade to these updated\npackages, which correct these issues.",
