  "title": "RHSA-2015:0383: ppc64-diag security, bug fix, and enhancement update (Moderate)",
  "description": "The ppc64-diag packages provide diagnostic tools for Linux on the 64-bit\nPowerPC platforms. The platform diagnostics write events reported by the\nfirmware to the service log, provide automated responses to urgent events,\nand notify system administrators or connected service frameworks about the\nreported events.\n\nMultiple insecure temporary file use flaws were found in the way the\nppc64-diag utility created certain temporary files. A local attacker could\npossibly use either of these flaws to perform a symbolic link attack and\noverwrite arbitrary files with the privileges of the user running\nppc64-diag, or obtain sensitive information from the temporary files.\n(CVE-2014-4038, CVE-2014-4039)\n\nThe ppc64-diag packages have been upgraded to upstream version 2.6.7, which\nprovides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the previous version\nincluding support for hot plugging of QEMU PCI devices. (BZ#1088493,\nBZ#1084062)\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* Prior to this update, the rtas_errd daemon was not started by default on\nsystem boot. With this update, rtas_errd has been modified to start\nautomatically by default. (BZ#1170146)\n\n* Previously, the /var/log/dump file was not automatically created when\ninstalling the ppc64-diag package. This bug has been fixed, and\n/var/log/dump is now created at package install time as expected.\n(BZ#1175808)\n\nIn addition, this update adds the following enhancement:\n\n* This update adds support for building the ppc64-diag packages on the\nlittle-endian variant of IBM Power Systems platform architecture. (BZ#1124007)\n\nUsers of ppc64-diag are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncorrect these issues and add these enhancements.",
