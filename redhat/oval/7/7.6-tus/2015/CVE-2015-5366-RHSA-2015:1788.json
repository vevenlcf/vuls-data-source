  "title": "RHSA-2015:1788: kernel-rt security, bug fix, and enhancement update (Important)",
  "description": "The kernel-rt packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux\noperating system.\n\n* A flaw was found in the kernel's implementation of the Berkeley Packet\nFilter (BPF). A local attacker could craft BPF code to crash the system by\ncreating a situation in which the JIT compiler would fail to correctly\noptimize the JIT image on the last pass. This would lead to the CPU\nexecuting instructions that were not part of the JIT code. (CVE-2015-4700,\nImportant)\n\n* Two flaws were found in the way the Linux kernel's networking\nimplementation handled UDP packets with incorrect checksum values. A remote\nattacker could potentially use these flaws to trigger an infinite loop in\nthe kernel, resulting in a denial of service on the system, or cause a\ndenial of service in applications using the edge triggered epoll\nfunctionality. (CVE-2015-5364, CVE-2015-5366, Important)\n\n* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's ext4 file system handled\nthe \"page size \u003e block size\" condition when the fallocate zero range\nfunctionality was used. A local attacker could use this flaw to crash the\nsystem. (CVE-2015-0275, Moderate)\n\n* It was found that the Linux kernel's keyring implementation would leak\nmemory when adding a key to a keyring via the add_key() function. A local\nattacker could use this flaw to exhaust all available memory on the system.\n(CVE-2015-1333, Moderate)\n\n* A race condition flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's SCTP\nimplementation handled Address Configuration lists when performing Address\nConfiguration Change (ASCONF). A local attacker could use this flaw to\ncrash the system via a race condition triggered by setting certain ASCONF\noptions on a socket. (CVE-2015-3212, Moderate)\n\n* An information leak flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's Virtual\nDynamic Shared Object (vDSO) implementation performed address\nrandomization. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to leak\nkernel memory addresses to user-space. (CVE-2014-9585, Low)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Daniel Borkmann for reporting CVE-2015-4700,\nand Canonical for reporting the CVE-2015-1333 issue. The CVE-2015-0275\nissue was discovered by Xiong Zhou of Red Hat, and the CVE-2015-3212 issue\nwas discovered by Ji Jianwen of Red Hat Engineering.\n\nThe kernel-rt packages have been upgraded to version 3.10.0-229.13.1, which\nprovides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the previous version,\nincluding:\n\n* Fix regression in scsi_send_eh_cmnd()\n\n* boot hangs at \"Console: switching to colour dummy device 80x25\"\n\n* Update tcp stack to 3.17 kernel\n\n* Missing some code from patch \"(...) Fix VGA switcheroo problem related to\nhotplug\"\n\n* ksoftirqd high CPU usage due to stray tasklet from ioatdma driver\n\n* During Live Partition Mobility (LPM) testing, RHEL 7.1 LPARs will crash\nin kmem_cache_alloc\n\n(BZ#1253809)\n\nThis update also fixes the following bug:\n\n* The hwlat_detector.ko module samples the clock and records any intervals\nbetween reads that exceed a specified threshold. However, the module\npreviously tracked the maximum interval seen for the \"inner\" interval but\ndid not record when the \"outer\" interval was greater. A patch has been\napplied to fix this bug, and hwlat_detector.ko now correctly records if the\nouter interval is the maximal interval encountered during the run.\n(BZ#1252365)\n\nAll kernel-rt users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncorrect these issues and add these enhancements. The system must be\nrebooted for this update to take effect.",
