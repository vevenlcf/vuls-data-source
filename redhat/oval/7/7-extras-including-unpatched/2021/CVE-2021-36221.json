  "description": "DOCUMENTATION: A race condition flaw was found in Go. The incoming requests body weren't closed after the handler panic and as a consequence this could lead to ReverseProxy crash.  The highest threat from this vulnerability is to Availability. \n            STATEMENT: * In Red Hat OpenStack Platform, because the flaw has a lower impact and the fix would require a substantial amount of development, no update will be provided at this time for the impacted RHOSP packages.\n\n* In Service Telemetry Framework, because the flaw has a lower impact and the package is not directly used by STF1.3, no update will be provided at this time for the STF1.3 sg-core-container. Additionally, because Service Telemetry Framework1.2 will be retiring soon, no update will be provided at this time for the STF1.2 smart-gateway-container.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
