  "title": "CVE-2021-20291 containers/storage: DoS via malicious image (moderate)",
  "description": "DOCUMENTATION: A deadlock vulnerability was found in `github.com/containers/storage`. When a container image is processed, each layer is unpacked using `tar`. If one of those layers is not a valid `tar` archive this causes an error leading to an unexpected situation where the code indefinitely waits for the tar unpacked stream, which never finishes. An attacker could use this vulnerability to craft a malicious image, which when downloaded and stored by an application using containers/storage, would then cause a deadlock leading to a Denial of Service (DoS).\n            STATEMENT: The vulnerability was first exposed in v1.23.8 of containers/storage (and subsequently fixed in v1.28.1) with this git commit [1].\n\n* In OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) only 4.7 contains a version of CRI-O (and openshift/ose-docker-builder) which uses a vulnerable version of containers/storage. Subsequently this has been addressed in OCP 4.7.7.\n\n* Red Hat Quay quay-builder-container is not affected because it uses a version of github.com/containers/storage earlier than v1.23.8\n\n* Red Hat Openshift Virtualization is not affected because all containers depending on github.com/containers/storage use a version earlier than v1.23.8\n\n* For Red Hat OpenStack Platform, because containers/storage is not directly used by the director-operator, no update will be provided at this time for the operator containers.\n\n[1] - https://github.com/containers/storage/blob/e9989a949a0d2c32fa82d3ff1076e33cfec58cb9/layers.go#L1332",
