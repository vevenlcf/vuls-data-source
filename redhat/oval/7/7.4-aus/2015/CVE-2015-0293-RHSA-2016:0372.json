  "description": "OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3)\nand Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols, as well as a\nfull-strength, general purpose cryptography library.\n\nA padding oracle flaw was found in the Secure Sockets Layer version 2.0\n(SSLv2) protocol. An attacker can potentially use this flaw to decrypt\nRSA-encrypted cipher text from a connection using a newer SSL/TLS protocol\nversion, allowing them to decrypt such connections. This cross-protocol\nattack is publicly referred to as DROWN. (CVE-2016-0800)\n\nNote: This issue was addressed by disabling the SSLv2 protocol by default\nwhen using the 'SSLv23' connection methods, and removing support for weak\nSSLv2 cipher suites. For more information, refer to the knowledge base\narticle linked to in the References section.\n\nIt was discovered that the SSLv2 servers using OpenSSL accepted SSLv2\nconnection handshakes that indicated non-zero clear key length for\nnon-export cipher suites. An attacker could use this flaw to decrypt\nrecorded SSLv2 sessions with the server by using it as a decryption \noracle.(CVE-2016-0703)\n\nIt was discovered that the SSLv2 protocol implementation in OpenSSL did\nnot properly implement the Bleichenbacher protection for export cipher\nsuites. An attacker could use a SSLv2 server using OpenSSL as a\nBleichenbacher oracle. (CVE-2016-0704)\n\nNote: The CVE-2016-0703 and CVE-2016-0704 issues could allow for more\nefficient exploitation of the CVE-2016-0800 issue via the DROWN attack.\n\nA denial of service flaw was found in the way OpenSSL handled SSLv2\nhandshake messages. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause a\nTLS/SSL server using OpenSSL to exit on a failed assertion if it had both\nthe SSLv2 protocol and EXPORT-grade cipher suites enabled. (CVE-2015-0293)\n\nA flaw was found in the way malicious SSLv2 clients could negotiate SSLv2\nciphers that have been disabled on the server. This could result in weak\nSSLv2 ciphers being used for SSLv2 connections, making them vulnerable to\nman-in-the-middle attacks. (CVE-2015-3197)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the OpenSSL project for reporting these issues.\nUpstream acknowledges Nimrod Aviram and Sebastian Schinzel as the original\nreporters of CVE-2016-0800 and CVE-2015-3197; David Adrian (University of\nMichigan) and J. Alex Halderman (University of Michigan) as the original\nreporters of CVE-2016-0703 and CVE-2016-0704; and Sean Burford (Google) and\nEmilia KÃ¤sper (OpenSSL development team) as the original reporters of\nCVE-2015-0293.\n\nAll openssl098e users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,\nwhich contain backported patches to correct these issues. For the update\nto take effect, all services linked to the openssl098e library must be\nrestarted, or the system rebooted.",
