  "description": "The 389 Directory Server is an LDAP version 3 (LDAPv3) compliant server.\nThe base packages include the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)\nserver and command-line utilities for server administration.\n\nAn infinite-loop vulnerability was discovered in the 389 directory server,\nwhere the server failed to correctly handle unexpectedly closed client\nconnections. A remote attacker able to connect to the server could use this\nflaw to make the directory server consume an excessive amount of CPU and\nstop accepting connections (denial of service). (CVE-2016-0741)\n\nThis update fixes the following bugs:\n\n* Previously, if a simple paged results search failed in the back end, the\nsimple paged results slot was not released. Consequently, the simple paged\nresults slots in a connection object could be accumulated. With this\nupdate, the simple paged results slot is released correctly when a search\nfails, and unused simple paged results slots are no longer left in a\nconnection object. (BZ#1290725)\n\n* Previously, when several values of the same attribute were deleted using\nthe ldapmodify command, and at least one of them was added again during the\nsame operation, the equality index was not updated. As a consequence, an\nexact search for the re-added attribute value did not return the entry. The\nlogic of the index code has been modified to update the index if at least\none of the values in the entry changes, and the exact search for the\nre-added attribute value now returns the correct entry. (BZ#1290726)\n\n* Prior to this update, when the cleanAllRUV task was running, a bogus\nattrlist_replace error message was logged repeatedly due to a memory\ncorruption. With this update, the appropriate memory copy function memmove\nis used, which fixes the memory corruption. As a result, the error messages\nare no longer logged in this scenario. (BZ#1295684)\n\n* To fix a simple paged results bug, an exclusive lock on a connection was\npreviously added. This consequently caused a self deadlock in a particular\ncase. With this update, the exclusive lock on a connection has been changed\nto the re-entrant type, and the self deadlock no longer occurs.\n(BZ#1298105)\n\n* Previously, an unnecessary lock was sometimes acquired on a connection\nobject, which could consequently cause a deadlock. A patch has been applied\nto remove the unnecessary locking, and the deadlock no longer occurs.\n(BZ#1299346)\n\nUsers of 389-ds-base are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,\nwhich correct these issues. After installing this update, the 389 server\nservice will be restarted automatically.",
