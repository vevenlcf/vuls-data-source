  "title": "RHSA-2017:2836: dnsmasq security update (Critical)",
  "description": "The dnsmasq packages contain Dnsmasq, a lightweight DNS (Domain Name Server) forwarder and DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) server.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* A heap buffer overflow was found in dnsmasq in the code responsible for building DNS replies. An attacker could send crafted DNS packets to dnsmasq which would cause it to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-14491)\n\n* A heap buffer overflow was discovered in dnsmasq in the IPv6 router advertisement (RA) handling code. An attacker on the local network segment could send crafted RAs to dnsmasq which would cause it to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected configurations using one of these options: enable-ra, ra-only, slaac, ra-names, ra-advrouter, or ra-stateless. (CVE-2017-14492)\n\n* A stack buffer overflow was found in dnsmasq in the DHCPv6 code. An attacker on the local network could send a crafted DHCPv6 request to dnsmasq which would cause it to a crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-14493)\n\n* An information leak was found in dnsmasq in the DHCPv6 relay code. An attacker on the local network could send crafted DHCPv6 packets to dnsmasq causing it to forward the contents of process memory, potentially leaking sensitive data. (CVE-2017-14494)\n\n* A memory exhaustion flaw was found in dnsmasq in the EDNS0 code. An attacker could send crafted DNS packets which would trigger memory allocations which would never be freed, leading to unbounded memory consumption and eventually a crash. This issue only affected configurations using one of the options: add-mac, add-cpe-id, or add-subnet. (CVE-2017-14495)\n\n* An integer underflow flaw leading to a buffer over-read was found in dnsmasq in the EDNS0 code. An attacker could send crafted DNS packets to dnsmasq which would cause it to crash. This issue only affected configurations using one of the options: add-mac, add-cpe-id, or add-subnet. (CVE-2017-14496)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Felix Wilhelm (Google Security Team), Fermin J. Serna (Google Security Team), Gabriel Campana (Google Security Team), Kevin Hamacher (Google Security Team), and Ron Bowes (Google Security Team) for reporting these issues.",
