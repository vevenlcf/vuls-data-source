  "extended_description": "\n\t\t\t\t\u003cxhtml:p\u003eA System-on-Chip (SoC) implements secure boot by verifying or authenticating signed boot code. The signing of the code is achieved by an entity that the SoC trusts.  Before executing the boot code, the SoC verifies that the code or the public key with which the code has been signed has not been tampered with. The other data upon which the SoC depends are system-hardware settings in fuses such as whether \"Secure Boot is enabled\". These data play a crucial role in establishing a Root of Trust (RoT) to execute secure-boot flows.\u003c/xhtml:p\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\u003cxhtml:p\u003eOne of the many ways RoT is achieved is by storing the code and data in memory or fuses. This memory should be immutable, i.e., once the RoT is programmed/provisioned in memory, that memory should be locked and prevented from further programming or writes. If the memory contents (i.e., RoT) are mutable, then an adversary can modify the RoT to execute their choice of code, resulting in a compromised secure boot.\u003c/xhtml:p\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\u003cxhtml:p\u003eNote that, for components like ROM, secure patching/update features should be supported to allow authenticated and authorized updates in the field. \u003c/xhtml:p\u003e\n\t\t\t",

Similarly, if the boot code is stored in ROM (Read-Only Memory) but the public key or the hash of the public key (used to enable \"Secure Boot\") is stored in Flash or a memory that is susceptible to modifications or writes, the implementation is vulnerable.\u003c/Intro_Text\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003cBody_Text\u003eIn general, if the boot code, key materials and data that enable \"Secure Boot\" are all mutable, the implementation is vulnerable.\u003c/Body_Text\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003cBody_Text\u003eGood architecture defines RoT as immutable in hardware.
