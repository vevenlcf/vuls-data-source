For example, consider a scenario in which several threads are accessing student records at the same time. The method which sets the student ID to a new value will need to make sure that nobody else is accessing this data at the same time and will require synchronization.\u003c/Body_Text\u003e\n               \u003cExample_Code Nature=\"good\"\u003e\n                  \u003cxhtml:div\u003epublic void setID(int ID){\u003cxhtml:div style=\"margin-left:10px;\"\u003esynchronized(this){\u003cxhtml:div style=\"margin-left:10px;\"\u003ethis.ID = ID;\u003c/xhtml:div\u003e}\u003c/xhtml:div\u003e}\u003c/xhtml:div\u003e\n               \u003c/Example_Code\u003e\n            "
