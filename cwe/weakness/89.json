This is because it effectively limits what will appear in output. Input validation will not always prevent SQL injection, especially if you are required to support free-form text fields that could contain arbitrary characters. For example, the name \"O'Reilly\" would likely pass the validation step, since it is a common last name in the English language. However, it cannot be directly inserted into the database because it contains the \"'\" apostrophe character, which would need to be escaped or otherwise handled. In this case, stripping the apostrophe might reduce the risk of SQL injection, but it would produce incorrect behavior because the wrong name would be recorded.\u003c/xhtml:p\u003e\n                  \u003cxhtml:p\u003eWhen feasible, it may be safest to disallow meta-characters entirely, instead of escaping them.

Allowlists can be a very effective means of enforcing strict input validation rules, but parameterized SQL statements require less maintenance and can offer more guarantees with respect to security. As is almost always the case, denylisting is riddled with loopholes that make it ineffective at preventing SQL injection attacks. For example, attackers can:\u003c/Body_Text\u003e\n               \u003cBody_Text\u003e\n                  \u003cxhtml:ul\u003e\n                     \u003cxhtml:li\u003e\n                        \u003cxhtml:div\u003eTarget fields that are not quoted\u003c/xhtml:div\u003e\n                     \u003c/xhtml:li\u003e\n                     \u003cxhtml:li\u003e\n                        \u003cxhtml:div\u003eFind ways to bypass the need for certain escaped meta-characters\u003c/xhtml:div\u003e\n                     \u003c/xhtml:li\u003e\n                     \u003cxhtml:li\u003e\n                        \u003cxhtml:div\u003eUse stored procedures to hide the injected meta-characters.\u003c/xhtml:div\u003e\n                     \u003c/xhtml:li\u003e\n                  \u003c/xhtml:ul\u003e\n               \u003c/Body_Text\u003e\n               \u003cBody_Text\u003eManually escaping characters in input to SQL queries can help, but it will not make your application secure from SQL injection attacks.\u003c/Body_Text\u003e\n               \u003cBody_Text\u003eAnother solution commonly proposed for dealing with SQL injection attacks is to use stored procedures. Although stored procedures prevent some types of SQL injection attacks, they do not protect against many others. For example, the following PL/SQL procedure is vulnerable to the same SQL injection attack shown in the first example.\u003c/Body_Text\u003e\n               \u003cExample_Code Nature=\"bad\"\u003e\n                  \u003cxhtml:div\u003eprocedure get_item ( itm_cv IN OUT ItmCurTyp, usr in varchar2, itm in varchar2)\u003cxhtml:br/\u003eis open itm_cv for\u003cxhtml:br/\u003e' SELECT * FROM items WHERE ' || 'owner = '|| usr || ' AND itemname = ' || itm || ';\u003cxhtml:br/\u003eend get_item;\u003c/xhtml:div\u003e\n               \u003c/Example_Code\u003e\n               \u003cBody_Text\u003eStored procedures typically help prevent SQL injection attacks by limiting the types of statements that can be passed to their parameters. However, there are many ways around the limitations and many interesting statements that can still be passed to stored procedures. Again, stored procedures can prevent some exploits, but they will not make your application secure against SQL injection attacks.\u003c/Body_Text\u003e\n            "

First of all, the user is still allowed to provide hyphens, which are used as comment structures in SQL. If a user specifies \"--\" then the remainder of the statement will be treated as a comment, which may bypass security logic. Furthermore, the allowlist permits the apostrophe, which is also a data / command separator in SQL. If a user supplies a name with an apostrophe, they may be able to alter the structure of the whole statement and even change control flow of the program, possibly accessing or modifying confidential information. In this situation, both the hyphen and apostrophe are legitimate characters for a last name and permitting them is required. Instead, a programmer may want to use a prepared statement or apply an encoding routine to the input to prevent any data / directive misinterpretations.\u003c/Body_Text\u003e\n            "
