For Java objects, such as String objects, the \"==\" operator compares object references, not object values. While the two String objects above contain the same string values, they refer to different object references, so the System.out.println statement will not be executed. To compare object values, the previous code could be modified to use the equals method:\u003c/Body_Text\u003e\n               \u003cExample_Code Nature=\"good\"\u003e\n                  \u003cxhtml:div\u003eif (str1.equals(str2)) {\u003cxhtml:div style=\"margin-left:10px;\"\u003eSystem.out.println(\"str1 equals str2\");\u003c/xhtml:div\u003e}\u003c/xhtml:div\u003e\n               \u003c/Example_Code\u003e\n            "
