There are no commonly-used definitions, even within\n\t   standards documents and cryptography papers. Future versions of\n\t   CWE will attempt to define these terms and, if necessary,\n\t   distinguish between them in ways that are appropriate for\n\t   different communities but do not reduce the usability of CWE for\n\t   mapping, understanding, or other scenarios."
