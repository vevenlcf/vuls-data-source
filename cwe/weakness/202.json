CWE-202 is also being considered for deprecation, as it is not clearly described and may have been misunderstood by CWE users.  It could be argued that this issue is better covered by CAPEC; an attacker can utilize their data-query privileges to perform this kind of operation, and if the attacker should not be allowed to perform the operation - or if the sensitive data should not have been made accessible at all - then that is more appropriately classified as a separate CWE related to authorization (see the parent, CWE-1230).\u003c/xhtml:p\u003e\n\t    "
