  "extended_description": "\n            \u003cxhtml:p\u003eIn environments such as embedded or mobile devices, power can be a limited resource such as a battery, which cannot be automatically replenished by the software itself, and the device might not always be directly attached to a reliable power source. If the software uses too much power too quickly, then this could cause the device (and subsequently, the software) to stop functioning until power is restored, or increase the financial burden on the device owner because of increased power costs.\u003c/xhtml:p\u003e\n            \u003cxhtml:p\u003eNormal operation of an application will consume power.
