For example, a compiler might convert an int to Integer (called autoboxing) or an Integer to int (called unboxing). This eliminates forcing the programmer to perform these conversions manually, which makes the code cleaner.\u003c/xhtml:p\u003e\n\t    \u003cxhtml:p\u003eHowever, this feature comes at a cost of performance and can lead to resource exhaustion and impact availability when used with generic collections. Therefore, they should not be used for scientific computing or other performance critical operations. They are only suited to support \"impedance mismatch\" between reference types and primitives.\u003c/xhtml:p\u003e\n         ",
