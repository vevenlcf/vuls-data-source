The only option might be replacement of the product, which could be too financially or operationally expensive for the product owner.  As a result, the inability to patch or update can leave the product open to attacker exploitation or critical operation failures. This weakness can be especially difficult to manage when using ROM, firmware, or similar components that traditionally have had limited or no update capabilities.\n\t\t\t  \u003c/xhtml:p\u003e\n\t\t\t  \u003cxhtml:p\u003e\n\t\t\t    In industries such as healthcare, \"legacy\"\n\t\t\t    devices can be operated for decades.
