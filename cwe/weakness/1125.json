  "extended_description": "\u003cxhtml:p\u003eOriginating from software security, an \"attack surface\" measure typically reflects the number of input points and output points that can be utilized by an untrusted party, i.e. a potential attacker. A larger attack surface provides more places to attack, and more opportunities for developers to introduce weaknesses.  In some cases, this measure may reflect other aspects of quality besides security; e.g., a product with many inputs and outputs may require a large number of tests in order to improve code coverage.\u003c/xhtml:p\u003e",
