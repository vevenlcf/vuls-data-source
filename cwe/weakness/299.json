  "description": "The software does not check or incorrectly checks the revocation status of a certificate, which may cause it to use a certificate that has been compromised.",

This is because the use of any revoked certificate is almost certainly malicious. The most common reason for certificate revocation is compromise of the system in question, with the result that no legitimate servers will be using a revoked certificate, unless they are sorely out of sync.",
