Examples include debuggers that directly attach to the running process; system-call tracing utilities such as truss (Solaris) and strace (Linux); system activity monitors such as FileMon, RegMon, Process Monitor, and other Sysinternals utilities (Windows); and sniffers and protocol analyzers that monitor network traffic.\u003c/xhtml:p\u003e\n                  \u003cxhtml:p\u003eAttach the monitor to the process and perform a login.
