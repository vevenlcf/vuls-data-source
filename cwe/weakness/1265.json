  "extended_description": "In complex software, a single function call may lead to many different possible code paths, some of which may involve deeply nested calls. It may be difficult to foresee all possible code paths that could emanate from a given function call. In some systems, an external actor can manipulate inputs to the system and thereby achieve a wide range of possible control flows. This is frequently of concern in software that executes script from untrusted sources. Examples of such software are web browsers and PDF readers. A weakness is present when one of the possible code paths resulting from a function call alters program state that the original caller assumes to be unchanged during the call.",

        "When architecting a system that will execute untrusted code in response to events, consider executing the untrusted event handlers asynchronously (asynchronous message passing) as opposed to executing them synchronously at the time each event fires. The untrusted code should execute at the start of the next iteration of the thread’s message loop. In this way, calls into non-reentrant code are strictly serialized, so that each operation completes fully before the next operation begins. Special attention must be paid to all places where type coercion may result in script execution. Performing all needed coercions at the very beginning of an operation can help reduce the chance of operations executing at unexpected junctures."

The code within fireOnImageClick() invokes the appropriate script handler routine as defined by the document being rendered. In this scenario this script routine is supplied by an adversary and this malicious script makes a call to Widget::changeBackgroundImage(), deleting the Image object pointed to by backgroundImage. When control returns to Image::click, the function’s \"backgroundImage \"this\" pointer (which is the former value of backgroundImage) is a dangling pointer. The root of this weakness is that while one operation on Widget (click) is in the midst of executing, a second operation on the Widget object may be invoked (in this case, the second invocation is a call to different method, namely changeBackgroundImage) that modifies the non-local variable.\u003c/Body_Text\u003e\n\t\t\t"

Request::send() calls scriptEngine-\u0026gt;coerceToString(_data) to coerce a script-provided parameter into a string. This operation may produce script execution. For example, if the script language is ECMAScript, arbitrary script execution may result if _data is an adversary-supplied ECMAScript object having a custom toString method. If the adversary's script makes a new call to Request::setup, then when control returns to Request::send, the field uri and the local variable credentials will no longer be consistent with one another. As a result, credentials for one resource will be shared improperly with a different resource. The root of this weakness is that while one operation on Request (send) is in the midst of executing, a second operation may be invoked (setup).\u003c/Body_Text\u003e\n\t\t\t"
