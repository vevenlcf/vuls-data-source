Examples include debuggers that directly attach to the running process; system-call tracing utilities such as truss (Solaris) and strace (Linux); system activity monitors such as FileMon, RegMon, Process Monitor, and other Sysinternals utilities (Windows); and sniffers and protocol analyzers that monitor network traffic.\u003c/xhtml:p\u003e\n                  \u003cxhtml:p\u003eAttach the monitor to the process, trigger the feature that sends the data, and look for the presence or absence of common cryptographic functions in the call tree.
