If these resources are not also restricted, then attackers might be able to extract some or all of the original information, or otherwise infer some details.  For example, an attacker could specify search terms that are known to be unique to a particular person, or view metadata such as activity or creation dates in order to identify usage patterns.\u003c/xhtml:p\u003e\n            ",
