  "description": "If no mechanism is in place for managing password aging, users will have no incentive to update passwords in a timely manner.",
  "extended_description": "Security experts have often recommended that users change their passwords regularly and avoid reusing passwords. Although this can be an effective mitigation, if the expiration window is too short, it can cause users to generate poor or predictable passwords. As such, it is important to discourage creating similar passwords. It is also useful to have a password aging mechanism that notifies users when passwords are considered old and requests that they replace them with new, strong passwords. Companion documentation which stresses how important this practice is can help users understand and better support this approach.",
