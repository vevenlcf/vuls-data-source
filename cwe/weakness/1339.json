If the fraction can be represented in a fixed number of digits (binary or decimal), there might not be enough digits assigned to represent the number. In other cases the number cannot be represented in a fixed number of digits due to repeating in decimal or binary notation (e.g. 0.333333...) or due to a transcendental number such as Π  or √2.

    "There are three major ways to store real numbers in computers. Each method is described along with the limitations of how they store their numbers.\n            \u003cxhtml:ol\u003e\n                        \u003cxhtml:li\u003eFixed: Some implementations use a fixed number of binary bits to represent both the integer and the fraction.  In the demonstrative example about Muller's Recurrence, the fraction 108.0 - ((815.0 - 1500.0 / z) / y) cannot be represented in 8 binary digits. The numeric accuracy within languages such as PL/1, COBOL and Ada is expressed in decimal digits rather than binary digits. In SQL and most databases, the length of the integer and the fraction are specified by the programmer in decimal. In the language C, fixed reals are implemented according to ISO/IEC TR18037\u003c/xhtml:li\u003e\n                        \u003cxhtml:li\u003eFloating: The number is stored in a version of scientific notation with a fixed length for the base and the significand. This allows flexibility for more accuracy when the integer portion is smaller. When dealing with large integers, the fractional accuracy is less. Languages such as PL/1, COBOL and Ada set the accuracy by decimal digit representation rather than using binary digits. Python also implements decimal floating-point numbers using the IEEE 754-2008 encoding method.\u003c/xhtml:li\u003e\n                        \u003cxhtml:li\u003eRatio: The number is stored as the ratio of two integers. These integers also have their limits. These integers can be stored in a fixed number of bits or in a vector of digits. While the vector of digits method provides for very large integers, they cannot truly represent a repeating or transcendental number as those numbers do not ever have a fixed length.\u003c/xhtml:li\u003e\n                    \u003c/xhtml:ol\u003e\n                "

        "The developer or maintainer can move to a more accurate representation of real numbers.  In extreme cases, the programmer can move to representations such as ratios of BigInts which can represent real numbers to extremely fine precision. The programmer can also use the concept of an Unum real. The memory and CPU tradeoffs of this change must be examined. Since floating point reals are used in many programs and many locations, they are implemented in hardware and most format changes will cause the calculations to be moved into software resulting in slower programs.

The data structure of Ratio comes in three different implementations: i32 uses a ratio of 32 bit signed  integers,  i64 uses a ratio of 64 bit signed integers and BigInt uses a ratio of signed integer with up to 2^32 digits of base 256.
