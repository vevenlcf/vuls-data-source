In this case, there are no clear CWE Weaknesses that can be utilized. \"Inappropriate Configuration\" might be better described as a Weakness, so this entry might be converted to a Weakness in a later version. Further research is required, however, as a \"configuration weakness\" might be Primary to many other CWEs, i.e., it might be better described in terms of chaining relationships."
