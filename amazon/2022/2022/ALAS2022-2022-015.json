  "title": "Amazon Linux 2022 - ALAS2022-2022-015: medium priority package update for webkit2gtk3",
  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2022 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2021-45483:\n\tA use-after-free vulnerability was found in webkitgtk. An attacker with network access could pass specially crafted HTML files causing an application to halt or crash.\n\nCVE-2021-45482:\n\tA use-after-free vulnerability was found in webkitgtk. An attacker with network access could pass specially crafted HTML files causing an application to halt or crash.\n\nCVE-2021-45481:\n\tA segmentation violation vulnerability was found in webkitgtk. An attacker with network access could pass specially crafted HTML files causing an application to halt or crash.\n\nCVE-2021-42762:\n\tBubblewrapLauncher.cpp in WebKitGTK and WPE WebKit before 2.34.1 allows a limited sandbox bypass that allows a sandboxed process to trick host processes into thinking the sandboxed process is not confined by the sandbox, by abusing VFS syscalls that manipulate its filesystem namespace. The impact is limited to host services that create UNIX sockets that WebKit mounts inside its sandbox, and the sandboxed process remains otherwise confined. NOTE: this is similar to CVE-2021-41133.\n\nCVE-2021-30897:\n\tA flaw was found in the resource timing API specification and its implementation in WebKitGTK. A malicious web site could use this flaw to trigger a cross-domain data exfiltration.\n\nCVE-2021-30889:\n\tA buffer overflow flaw was found in WebKitGTK. Specially crafted web content could use this flaw to trigger an arbitrary code execution when processed.\n\nCVE-2021-30888:\n\tAn information leak flaw was found in WebKitGTK. A malicious web site using Content Security Policy reports could use this flaw to leak information via redirects.\n\nCVE-2021-30884:\n\tA flaw was found in the way WebKitGTK performed CSS compositing. A malicious web site could possibly use this flaw to reveal user's browsing history.\n\nCVE-2021-30858:\n\tA flaw was found in webkitgtk. This flaw could allow an attacker to use maliciously crafted web content leading to arbitrary code execution.\n\nCVE-2021-30851:\n\tA memory corruption vulnerability was addressed with improved locking. This issue is fixed in Safari 15, tvOS 15, watchOS 8, iOS 15 and iPadOS 15. Processing maliciously crafted web content may lead to code execution.\n\nCVE-2021-30849:\n\tMultiple memory corruption issues were addressed with improved memory handling. This issue is fixed in iOS 14.8 and iPadOS 14.8, watchOS 8, Safari 15, tvOS 15, iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, iTunes 12.12 for Windows. Processing maliciously crafted web content may lead to arbitrary code execution.\n\nCVE-2021-30848:\n\tA memory corruption issue was addressed with improved memory handling. This issue is fixed in iOS 14.8 and iPadOS 14.8, Safari 15, iOS 15 and iPadOS 15. Processing maliciously crafted web content may lead to code execution.\n\nCVE-2021-30846:\n\tA memory corruption issue was addressed with improved memory handling. This issue is fixed in iOS 14.8 and iPadOS 14.8, Safari 15, tvOS 15, iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, watchOS 8. Processing maliciously crafted web content may lead to arbitrary code execution.\n\nCVE-2021-30836:\n\tAn out-of-bounds read flaw was found in WebKitGTK. A specially crafted audio file could use this flaw to trigger a disclosure of memory when processed.\n\nCVE-2021-30823:\n\tA logic issue was found in WebKitGTK. An attacker in a privileged network position could use this flaw to bypass HSTS.\n\nCVE-2021-30818:\n\tA confusion type flaw was found in WebKitGTK. Specially crafted web content could use this flaw to trigger an arbitrary code execution when processed.\n\nCVE-2021-30809:\n\tA use-after-free flaw was found in WebKitGTK. Specially crafted web content could use this flaw to trigger an arbitrary code execution when processed.\n",
