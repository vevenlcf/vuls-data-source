  "title": "Amazon Linux 2 2017.12 - ALAS2-2022-1742: medium priority package update for python-pip",
  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2021-3572:\n\tA flaw was found in python-pip in the way it handled Unicode separators in git references. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to install a different revision on a repository. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data integrity.\n\nCVE-2021-28363:\n\tA flaw was found in python-urllib3. SSL certificate validation is omitted in some cases involving HTTPS to HTTPS proxies. The initial connection to the HTTPS proxy (if an SSLContext isn't given via proxy_config) doesn't verify the hostname of the certificate. This means certificates for different servers that still validate properly with the default urllib3 SSLContext will be silently accepted.\n",
