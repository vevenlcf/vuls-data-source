  "title": "Amazon Linux 2 2017.12 - ALAS2-2022-1750: important priority package update for log4j",
  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2022-23307:\n\tA flaw was found in the log4j 1.x chainsaw component, where the contents of certain log entries are deserialized and possibly permit code execution. This flaw allows an attacker to send a malicious request with serialized data to the server to be deserialized when the chainsaw component is run.\n\nCVE-2022-23305:\n\tA flaw was found in the Java logging library Apache Log4j in version 1.x. JDBCAppender in Log4j 1.x is vulnerable to SQL injection in untrusted data. This allows a remote attacker to run SQL statements in the database if the deployed application is configured to use JDBCAppender with certain interpolation tokens.\n\nCVE-2022-23302:\n\tA flaw was found in the Java logging library Apache Log4j in version 1.x. JMSSink in Log4j 1.x is vulnerable to deserialization of untrusted data. This allows a remote attacker to execute code on the server if JMSSink is deployed and has been configured to perform JNDI requests.\n",
