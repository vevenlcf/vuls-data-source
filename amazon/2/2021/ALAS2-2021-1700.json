  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2021-22925:\n\tA flaw was found in the way curl handled telnet protocol option for sending environment variables, which could lead to sending of uninitialized data from a stack-based buffer to the server. This issue leads to potentially revealing sensitive internal information to the server using a clear-text network protocol.\n1970902: CVE-2021-22925 curl: Incorrect fix for CVE-2021-22898 TELNET stack contents disclosure\n\nCVE-2021-22924:\n\tA flaw was found in libcurl in the way libcurl handles previously used connections without accounting for 'issuer cert' and comparing the involved paths case-insensitively. This flaw allows libcurl to use the wrong connection. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality.\n1981460: CVE-2021-22924 curl: Bad connection reuse due to flawed path name checks\n\nCVE-2021-22923:\n\tA flaw was found in curl in the way curl handles credentials when downloading content using the Metalink feature. This flaw allows malicious actors controlling a hosting server to gain access to credentials provided while downloading content without the user's knowledge. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality.\n1981438: CVE-2021-22923 curl: Metalink download sends credentials\n\nCVE-2021-22922:\n\tA flaw was found in curl in the way curl handles a file hash mismatch after downloading content using the Metalink feature. This flaw allows malicious actors controlling a hosting server to trick users into downloading malicious content. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to integrity.\n1981435: CVE-2021-22922 curl: Content not matching hash in Metalink is not being discarded\n\nCVE-2021-22898:\n\tA flaw was found in the way curl handled telnet protocol option for sending environment variables, which could lead to sending of uninitialized data from a stack-based buffer to the server. This issue leads to potentially revealing sensitive internal information to the server using a clear-text network protocol.\n1964887: CVE-2021-22898 curl: TELNET stack contents disclosure\n",
