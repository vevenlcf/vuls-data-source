  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2 that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2020-6514:\n\tInappropriate implementation in WebRTC in Google Chrome prior to 84.0.4147.89 allowed an attacker in a privileged network position to potentially exploit heap corruption via a crafted SCTP stream.\n1857349: CVE-2020-6514 chromium-browser: Inappropriate implementation in WebRTC\n\nCVE-2020-6463:\n\tUse after free in ANGLE in Google Chrome prior to 81.0.4044.122 allowed a remote attacker to potentially exploit heap corruption via a crafted HTML page.\n1840893: CVE-2020-6463 chromium-browser: Use after free in ANGLE\n\nCVE-2020-15659:\n\tMozilla developers and community members reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 78 and Firefox ESR 78.0. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 79, Firefox ESR \u003c 68.11, Firefox ESR \u003c 78.1, Thunderbird \u003c 68.11, and Thunderbird \u003c 78.1.\n1861572: CVE-2020-15659 Mozilla: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 79 and Firefox ESR 68.11\n\nCVE-2020-15652:\n\tBy observing the stack trace for JavaScript errors in web workers, it was possible to leak the result of a cross-origin redirect. This applied only to content that can be parsed as script. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 79, Firefox ESR \u003c 68.11, Firefox ESR \u003c 78.1, Thunderbird \u003c 68.11, and Thunderbird \u003c 78.1.\n1861570: CVE-2020-15652 Mozilla: Potential leak of redirect targets when loading scripts in a worker\n",
