  "title": "Amazon Linux AMI 2012.09 - ALAS-2013-185: important priority package update for java-1.6.0-openjdk",
  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux AMI that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2013-2431:\n\tIt was discovered that the Hotspot component did not properly handle certain intrinsic frames, and did not correctly perform MethodHandle lookups. An untrusted Java application or applet could use these flaws to bypass Java sandbox restrictions.\n\nCVE-2013-2430:\n\tIt was discovered that JPEGImageReader and JPEGImageWriter in the ImageIO component did not protect against modification of their state while performing certain native code operations. An untrusted Java application or applet could possibly use these flaws to trigger Java Virtual Machine memory corruption.\n\nCVE-2013-2429:\n\tIt was discovered that JPEGImageReader and JPEGImageWriter in the ImageIO component did not protect against modification of their state while performing certain native code operations. An untrusted Java application or applet could possibly use these flaws to trigger Java Virtual Machine memory corruption.\n\nCVE-2013-2426:\n\tThe JDBC driver manager could incorrectly call the toString() method in JDBC drivers, and the ConcurrentHashMap class could incorrectly call the defaultReadObject() method. An untrusted Java application or applet could possibly use these flaws to bypass Java sandbox restrictions.\n\nCVE-2013-2424:\n\tThe MBeanInstantiator class implementation in the OpenJDK JMX component did not properly check class access before creating new instances. An untrusted Java application or applet could use this flaw to create instances of non-public classes.\n\nCVE-2013-2422:\n\tMultiple improper permission check issues were discovered in the Beans, Libraries, JAXP, and RMI components in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use these flaws to bypass Java sandbox restrictions.\n\nCVE-2013-2421:\n\tIt was discovered that the Hotspot component did not properly handle certain intrinsic frames, and did not correctly perform MethodHandle lookups. An untrusted Java application or applet could use these flaws to bypass Java sandbox restrictions.\n\nCVE-2013-2420:\n\tThe 2D component did not properly process certain images. An untrusted Java application or applet could possibly use this flaw to trigger Java Virtual Machine memory corruption.\n\nCVE-2013-2419:\n\tFlaws were discovered in the Network component's InetAddress serialization, and the 2D component's font handling. An untrusted Java application or applet could possibly use these flaws to crash the Java Virtual Machine.\n\nCVE-2013-2417:\n\tFlaws were discovered in the Network component's InetAddress serialization, and the 2D component's font handling. An untrusted Java application or applet could possibly use these flaws to crash the Java Virtual Machine.\n\nCVE-2013-2415:\n\tIt was discovered that JAX-WS could possibly create temporary files with insecure permissions. A local attacker could use this flaw to access temporary files created by an application using JAX-WS.\n\nCVE-2013-2384:\n\tMultiple flaws were discovered in the font layout engine in the 2D component. An untrusted Java application or applet could possibly use these flaws to trigger Java Virtual Machine memory corruption.\n\nCVE-2013-2383:\n\tMultiple flaws were discovered in the font layout engine in the 2D component. An untrusted Java application or applet could possibly use these flaws to trigger Java Virtual Machine memory corruption.\n\nCVE-2013-1569:\n\tMultiple flaws were discovered in the font layout engine in the 2D component. An untrusted Java application or applet could possibly use these flaws to trigger Java Virtual Machine memory corruption.\n\nCVE-2013-1558:\n\tMultiple improper permission check issues were discovered in the Beans, Libraries, JAXP, and RMI components in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use these flaws to bypass Java sandbox restrictions.\n\nCVE-2013-1557:\n\tMultiple improper permission check issues were discovered in the Beans, Libraries, JAXP, and RMI components in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use these flaws to bypass Java sandbox restrictions.\n\nCVE-2013-1537:\n\tThe previous default value of the java.rmi.server.useCodebaseOnly property permitted the RMI implementation to automatically load classes from remotely specified locations. An attacker able to connect to an application using RMI could use this flaw to make the application execute arbitrary code.\n\nCVE-2013-1518:\n\tMultiple improper permission check issues were discovered in the Beans, Libraries, JAXP, and RMI components in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use these flaws to bypass Java sandbox restrictions.\n\nCVE-2013-1488:\n\tThe JDBC driver manager could incorrectly call the toString() method in JDBC drivers, and the ConcurrentHashMap class could incorrectly call the defaultReadObject() method. An untrusted Java application or applet could possibly use these flaws to bypass Java sandbox restrictions.\n\nCVE-2013-0401:\n\tThe sun.awt.datatransfer.ClassLoaderObjectInputStream class may incorrectly invoke the system class loader. An untrusted Java application or applet could possibly use this flaw to bypass certain Java sandbox restrictions.\n",
