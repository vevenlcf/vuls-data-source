  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux AMI that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2013-4244:\n\tMultiple buffer overflow flaws were found in the gif2tiff tool. An attacker could use these flaws to create a specially crafted GIF file that could cause gif2tiff to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code.\n\nCVE-2013-4243:\n\tMultiple buffer overflow flaws were found in the gif2tiff tool. An attacker could use these flaws to create a specially crafted GIF file that could cause gif2tiff to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code.\n\nCVE-2013-4232:\n\tA heap-based buffer overflow and a use-after-free flaw were found in the tiff2pdf tool. An attacker could use these flaws to create a specially crafted TIFF file that would cause tiff2pdf to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code.\n\nCVE-2013-4231:\n\tMultiple buffer overflow flaws were found in the gif2tiff tool. An attacker could use these flaws to create a specially crafted GIF file that could cause gif2tiff to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code.\n\nCVE-2013-1961:\n\tMultiple buffer overflow flaws were found in the tiff2pdf tool.
