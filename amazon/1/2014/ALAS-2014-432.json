  "title": "Amazon Linux AMI 2014.03 - ALAS-2014-432: important priority package update for java-1.8.0-openjdk",
  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux AMI that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2014-6562:\n\tIt was discovered that the Libraries component in OpenJDK failed to properly handle ZIP archives that contain entries with a NUL byte used in the file names. An untrusted Java application or applet could use this flaw to bypass Java sandbox restrictions.\n\nCVE-2014-6558:\n\tIt was discovered that the CipherInputStream class implementation in OpenJDK did not properly handle certain exceptions. This could possibly allow an attacker to affect the integrity of an encrypted stream handled by this class.\n\nCVE-2014-6531:\n\tMultiple flaws were discovered in the Libraries, 2D, and Hotspot components in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use these flaws to bypass certain Java sandbox restrictions.\n\nCVE-2014-6519:\n\tMultiple flaws were discovered in the Libraries, 2D, and Hotspot components in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use these flaws to bypass certain Java sandbox restrictions.\n\nCVE-2014-6517:\n\tIt was discovered that the StAX XML parser in the JAXP component in OpenJDK performed expansion of external parameter entities even when external entity substitution was disabled. A remote attacker could use this flaw to perform XML eXternal Entity (XXE) attack against applications using the StAX parser to parse untrusted XML documents.\n\nCVE-2014-6512:\n\tIt was discovered that the DatagramSocket implementation in OpenJDK failed to perform source address checks for packets received on a connected socket. A remote attacker could use this flaw to have their packets processed as if they were received from the expected source.\n\nCVE-2014-6511:\n\tMultiple flaws were discovered in the Libraries, 2D, and Hotspot components in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use these flaws to bypass certain Java sandbox restrictions.\n\nCVE-2014-6506:\n\tMultiple flaws were discovered in the Libraries, 2D, and Hotspot components in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use these flaws to bypass certain Java sandbox restrictions.\n\nCVE-2014-6504:\n\tMultiple flaws were discovered in the Libraries, 2D, and Hotspot components in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use these flaws to bypass certain Java sandbox restrictions.\n\nCVE-2014-6502:\n\tMultiple flaws were discovered in the Libraries, 2D, and Hotspot components in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use these flaws to bypass certain Java sandbox restrictions.\n\nCVE-2014-6468:\n\tIt was discovered that the Hotspot component in OpenJDK failed to properly handle malformed Shared Archive files. A local attacker able to modify a Shared Archive file used by a virtual machine of a different user could possibly use this flaw to escalate their privileges.\n\nCVE-2014-6457:\n\tIt was discovered that the TLS/SSL implementation in the JSSE component in OpenJDK failed to properly verify the server identity during the renegotiation following session resumption, making it possible for malicious TLS/SSL servers to perform a Triple Handshake attack against clients using JSSE and client certificate authentication.\n",
