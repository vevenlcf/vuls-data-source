  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2012-2125:\n\tRubyGems before 1.8.23 can redirect HTTPS connections to HTTP, which makes it easier for remote attackers to observe or modify a gem during installation via a man-in-the-middle attack.\nIt was found that, when using RubyGems, the connection could be redirected from HTTPS to HTTP. This could lead to a user believing they are installing a gem via HTTPS, when the connection may have been silently downgraded to HTTP.\n814718: \nCVE-2012-2125 CVE-2012-2126 rubygems: Two security fixes in v1.8.23\n",
