  "title": "Amazon Linux - ALAS-2012-103: low priority package update for busybox",
  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2011-2716:\n\tThe BusyBox DHCP client, udhcpc, did not sufficiently sanitize certain options provided in DHCP server replies, such as the client hostname. A malicious DHCP server could send such an option with a specially-crafted value to a DHCP client. If this option's value was saved on the client system, and then later insecurely evaluated by a process that assumes the option is trusted, it could lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of that process. Note: udhcpc is not used on Red Hat Enterprise Linux by default, and no DHCP client script is provided with the busybox packages.\n\nCVE-2006-1168:\n\tThe decompress function in compress42.c in (1) ncompress 4.2.4 and (2) liblzw allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash), and possibly execute arbitrary code, via crafted data that leads to a buffer underflow.\nA buffer underflow flaw was found in the way the uncompress utility of BusyBox expanded certain archive files compressed using Lempel-Ziv compression. If a user were tricked into expanding a specially-crafted archive file with uncompress, it could cause BusyBox to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running BusyBox.\n",
