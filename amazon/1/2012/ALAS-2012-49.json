  "title": "Amazon Linux - ALAS-2012-49: important priority package update for libpng",
  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2011-3026:\n\tInteger overflow in libpng, as used in Google Chrome before 17.0.963.56, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via unknown vectors that trigger an integer truncation.\nA heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way XULRunner handled PNG (Portable Network Graphics) images. A web page containing a malicious PNG image could cause an application linked against XULRunner (such as Firefox) to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.\nA heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way Thunderbird handled PNG (Portable Network Graphics) images. An HTML mail message or remote content containing a specially-crafted PNG image could cause Thunderbird to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Thunderbird.\nA heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in libpng. An attacker could create a specially-crafted PNG image that, when opened, could cause an application using libpng to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.\n",
