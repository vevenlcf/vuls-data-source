  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux AMI that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2021-41103:\n\tCVE-2021-41103 containerd:\nA bug was found in containerd where container root directories and some plugins had insufficiently restricted permissions, allowing otherwise unprivileged Linux users to traverse directory contents and execute programs. When containers included executable programs with extended permission bits (such as setuid), unprivileged Linux users could discover and execute those programs. When the UID of an unprivileged Linux user on the host collided with the file owner or group inside a container, the unprivileged Linux user on the host could discover, read, and modify those files.\n",
